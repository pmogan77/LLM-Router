Recently, it has become clear that the impact of genomic islands on the evolution of different bacterial species is significant and represents a major force in establishing bacterial genomic variation. However, the study of genomic island evolution has been mostly performed at the sequence level using computer software or hybridization analysis to compare different bacterial genomic sequences. We describe here a novel experimental approach to study the evolution of species-specific bacterial genomic islands that identifies island genes that have evolved in such a way that they are differentially-expressed depending on the bacterial host background into which they are transferred.', 'We demonstrate this approach by using a ""test"" genomic island that we have cloned from the Salmonella typhimurium genome (island 4305) and transferred to a range of Gram negative bacterial hosts of differing evolutionary relationships to S. typhimurium. Systematic analysis of the expression of the island genes in the different hosts compared to proper controls allowed identification of genes with genera-specific expression patterns. The data from the analysis can be arranged in a matrix to give an expression ""array"" of the island genes in the different bacterial backgrounds. A conserved 19-bp DNA site was found upstream of at least two of the differentially-expressed island genes. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of horizontally-transferred genomic island gene expression in a broad range of Gram negative hosts. We also present evidence in this study that the IS200 element found in island 4305 in S. typhimurium strain LT2 was inserted after the island had already been acquired by the S. typhimurium lineage and that this element is likely not involved in the integration or excision of island 4305.\Question: Does a new experimental approach for studying bacterial genomic island evolution identify island genes with bacterial host-specific expression patterns?","The ""clone-and-transfer"" approach of evolutionary study identifies genes whose expression patterns indicate the existence of genera-specific regulatory mechanisms that influence the expression of horizontally-transferred DNA sections.

The mechanisms underlying the tumor suppression function of FoxOs in human cancers remain largely unknown. Aberrant expression and activation of Nrf2 often correlate with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. Here, we report that FoxO3 directs the basal transcription of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), an adaptor protein that bridges Nrf2 to Cul3 for degradation. FoxO3 depletion resulted in Keap1 down-regulation, thereby activating Nrf2 signaling. We further demonstrated that inhibition of the FoxO3-Keap1 axis accounts for Nrf2 induction and activation induced by constitutively active AKT signaling or tumor necrosis factor α treatment. Unlike previous findings, FoxO3 silencing led to decreased reactive oxygen species production, therefore protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced killing in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Importantly, FoxO3 deficiency strongly potentiated tumor formation in nude mice and rendered cholangiocarcinoma xenografts resistant to cisplatin-induced cell death by activating Nrf2. Additionally, we found that clinical cholangiocarcinoma samples displayed FoxO3-Keap1 down-regulation and Nrf2 hyperactivation, underscoring the essential roles of these proteins in cholangiocarcinoma development.\Question: Does foxO3 inactivation promote human cholangiocarcinoma tumorigenesis and chemoresistance through Keap1-Nrf2 signaling?",Our results unravel a unique mechanism underlying the tumor suppressor function of FoxO3 through constraining Nrf2 signaling.

Among these patients, 4,432 (46.1%) were classified as having culture-negative pneumonia, 1,940 (20.2%) as having pneumonia caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, 2,991 (31.1%) as having pneumonia caused by potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and 261 (2.7%) as having viral pneumonia. The 90-day hospital readmission rate for survivors (n = 7,637, 79.4%) was greatest for patients with pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria (11.4%) followed by viral pneumonia (8.3%), pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria (6.6%), and culture-negative pneumonia (5.8%) (P < .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria to be independently associated with 90-day readmission (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.56-1.97; P < .001). Other independent predictors of 90-day readmission were Charlson comorbidity score > 4, cirrhosis, and chronic kidney disease.

The endothelial glycocalyx, a layer of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans covering the luminal side of the vasculature, has recently emerged as an orchestrator of vascular homeostasis. In the present study, we investigated whether endotoxin-induced inflammatory reactions lead to a decrease of endothelial glycocalyx thickness in humans and whether tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) plays a role in this process.', 'Healthy male volunteers received low-dose endotoxin (1ng/kg) intravenously, with (n=8) or without (n=13) pre-treatment with the soluble TNFalpha receptor etanercept. Endothelial glycocalyx thickness and related parameters were determined after endotoxin challenge.', 'Endotoxin resulted in a profound reduction in microvascular glycocalyx thickness (from 0.60+/-0.1 to 0.30+/-0.1microm, p<0.01).

The adjuvant arthritis was induced in Lewis rats (AIA) and the effect on edema formation, TNF-α levels, and interleukin-1 beta levels after treatment was evaluated. Mononuclear cells obtained from the synovial fluid of RA patients during articular infiltration procedures were treated with MTX solution and MTX-LNC. For in vitro experiments, the same dose of MTX was used in comparing MTX and MTX-LNC, while the dose of MTX in the MTX-LNC was 75% lower than the drug in solution in in vivo experiments.', 'Formulations presented nanometric and unimodal size distribution profiles, with D[4.3] of 175±17 nm and span of 1.6±0.2.

Endpoints included prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall mortality (OM). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate survival, and Cox proportional hazards models were used for multivariate analysis.', 'Median follow-up post-SRT was 7.9 years.

One component of EF, concept formation, has not been well studied in this group.', 'Children (8 to 18 years) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with and without fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), were compared to typically developing controls on 2 measures of concept formation and conceptual set shifting: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the Card Sorting Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System. In addition to between-group comparisons, performance relative to overall intellectual functioning was examined.', 'Children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure showed impairment on both tests of concept formation compared to non-exposed controls. These deficits included difficulty generating and verbalizing concepts, increased error rates and perseverative responses, and poorer response to feedback. However, in comparison to controls, alcohol-exposed children performed better on measures of concept formation than predicted by their overall IQ scores. Exploratory analyses suggest that this may be due to differences in how the measures relate at different IQ levels and may not be specific to prenatal alcohol exposure.\Question: Do children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure demonstrate deficits on multiple measures of concept formation?",Deficits in concept formation and conceptual set shifting were observed in alcohol-exposed children with or without the diagnosis of FAS and in the absence of mental retardation. These deficits likely impact problem solving skills and adaptive functioning and have implications for therapeutic interventions in this population.,Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure demonstrate impairment on multiple measures of concept formation. These impairments may be exacerbated by the fact that the measures relate at different IQ levels.,0.2768558859825134

One possible application of TTE might be the replacement of ruptured tissue of the rotator cuff. Autologous tenocytes seem to be most suitable as no differentiation in vitro is necessary. Today it is still uncertain if there is a difference between tendon-derived cells (TDC) of different native tissues. Moreover, the search for suitable scaffolds is another important issue in TTE.', 'This study compared TDC of the long head of the biceps tendon (LHB), the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the tendon of the musculus semitendinosus (TMS). The TDC were isolated using the cell migration method. Cell morphology was assessed using light microscopy and gene expression was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Afterwards, cell seeding efficiency and proliferation were tested on a collagen I scaffold using the WST-1 assay. Results were confirmed using H + E staining.', 'The TDC of the LHB showed higher expression levels of collagen type I and decorin (p < 0.01) compared to TDC of other origin.

We conducted this prospective study to test the hypothesis that the outcome of LC is worse in men than women.', 'Between 1997 and 2002, a total of 391 consecutive LCs were performed by a single surgeon at King Fahd Hospital of the University. We collected and analyzed data including age, gender, body mass index (kg/m(2)), the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, mode of admission (elective or emergency), indication for LC (chronic or acute cholecystitis [AC]), comorbid disease, previous abdominal surgery, conversion to open cholecystectomy, complications, operation time, and length of postoperative hospital stay.', 'Bivariate analysis showed that both genders were matched for age, ASA class and mode of admission. The incidences of AC (P = 0.003) and comorbid disease (P = 0.031) were significantly higher in men. Women were significantly more obese than men (P < 0.001) and had a higher incidence of previous abdominal surgery (P = 0.017). There were no statistical differences between genders with regard to rates of conversion (P = 0.372) and complications (P = 0.647) and operation time (P = 0.063). The postoperative stay was significantly longer in men than women (P = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that male gender was not an independent predictor of conversion (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.37 and P = 0.43) or complications (OR = 0.42, P = 0.42). Linear regression analysis showed that male gender was not an independent predictor of the operation time, but was associated with a longer postoperative stay (P = 0.02).\Question: Is male gender a risk factor for the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy : a single surgeon experience?",Male gender is not an independent risk factor for satisfactory outcome of LC in the experience of a single surgeon.,Male gender was not an independent predictor of conversion or complications or operation time.,0.21939027309417725

However, studies to clarify factors predictive of histological change in patients with NASH remain scarce. Our aim is to determine predictors of histological progression in Japanese patients with biopsy-proven NASH.', 'This retrospective cohort study enrolled 52 patients with NASH who underwent serial liver biopsies. Histological evaluation included NAFLD activity score (NAS) and liver fibrosis. The median interval between initial and second liver biopsies was 968\u2009days. An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) response was defined as a decrease of 30% or more from baseline.', 'Of 52 patients, NAS was ameliorated in 30.8%, deteriorated in 30.8% and remained unchanged in 38.4%. Liver fibrosis was improved in 25.0% of patients, progressed in 25.0% and remained stable in 50.0%. Multivariate analysis identified ALT non-response as a predictor of deterioration of NAS (hazard ratio [HR], 5.85; P\u2009=\u20090.031) and progression of liver fibrosis (HR, 4.50; P\u2009=\u20090.029). The mean annual rate of fibrosis was 0.002 stages/year overall, increasing to 0.15 stages/year in ALT non-responders.\Question: Does serum alanine aminotransferase predict the histological course of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in Japanese patients?",A lack of reduction in serum ALT level by at least 30% from baseline was a predictor for histological progression in patients with NASH. Serum ALT level is a better predictor of histological change than insulin resistance or bodyweight and can be a valid index in treatment. Serum ALT should be strictly controlled to prevent liver histological progression in patients with NASH.,The results suggest that ALT non-response is a predictor of progression of NAS and liver fibrosis in patients with NASH.,0.28894203901290894

The aim of this study was to examine whether a sustained release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) would further improve thrombus recanalization.', 'Inferior caval vein thrombosis was induced in a cohort of 21 male Wistar rats. A plasmid encoding the human VEGF gene (phVEGF) was injected directly into thrombus (30 to 50 microg) and the muscle adjacent to the inferior vena cava (300 to 400 microg). A plasmid containing the gene encoding beta-galactosidase (pCMVbeta) was injected into the same sites of a separate cohort of rats to act as a control. Tissues were harvested after 1 and 2 weeks, and beta-galactosidase activity was measured to estimate transfection efficiency. Muscle and serum VEGF were measured by enzyme-inked immunosorbent assay. Thrombus size, recanalization, and organization were determined by computer-assisted image analysis.', 'The efficiency of control plasmid transfection into muscle was about 1%. No serum hVEGF was detected in phVEGF- or pCMVbeta-treated animals.
