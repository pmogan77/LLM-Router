Context_7 : Whole life insurance, or whole of life assurance (in the Commonwealth of Nations), sometimes called ""straight life"" or ""ordinary life,"" is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date. As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies. Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age.

Barrington Bayley's first published story, ""Combat's End"", appeared in May 1954. The editor was initially Alistair Paterson, but after seven issues Fearn took the helm: ""Vargo Statten"" was one of Fearn's aliases, and the magazine's title had been chosen because of his popularity. Neither Paterson nor Fearn had enough of a budget to attract good quality submissions, and a printing strike in 1956 brought an end to the magazine's life.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.","Context_1 : Hear the Silence is a 2003 semi-fictional TV drama based on the MMR vaccine controversy, which started when Andrew Wakefield published a paper claiming a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism. It debuted on December 15, 2003 at 9 PM on the British network Five. The film, produced at a cost of about 1 million pounds, stars Hugh Bonneville as Wakefield and Juliet Stevenson as Christine Shields, a fictional mother who discovers the possible MMR-autism link when her son is diagnosed as autistic. Stevenson's character begins telling doctor after doctor that her son seemed to develop autism soon after he received the MMR vaccine, but she does not receive any sympathy from them, nor does she receive any from her boss, or even her husband. However, this all changes when she meets Dr. Wakefield, who believes her statements about the MMR vaccine causing her son's autism. The film then shows fictional government officials ""plotting"" Wakefield's ""demise"", which they intend to bring about by portraying his research as flawed. Although never documented in reality, the film depicts Wakefield being targeted by the government: his phone is tapped and his files are stolen. The film attracted 1.2 million viewers on the first night it screened, considerably fewer than usual for Channel Five's films that debut at 9 PM, which often get more than 2 million viewers. Context_2 : Arthur Krigsman, MD, is a pediatrician and gastroenterologist best known for his controversial and research in which he attempted to prove that the MMR vaccine caused diseases, especially autism. He specializes in the evaluation and treatment of gastrointestinal pathology in children with autism spectrum disorders, and has written in support of what he calls autistic enterocolitis. The original study that tied the MMR vaccine to autism and GI complaints conducted by one of Krigsman's associates has been found to be fraudulent, and the diagnosis of ""autistic enterocolitis"" has not been accepted by the medical community. Context_3 : Maurice Ralph Hilleman (August 30, 1919 – April 11, 2005) was an American microbiologist who specialized in vaccinology and developed over 40 vaccines, an unparalleled record of productivity. Of the 14 vaccines routinely recommended in current vaccine schedules, he developed eight: those for measles, mumps, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, meningitis, pneumonia and ""Haemophilus influenzae"" bacteria. He also played a role in the discovery of the cold-producing adenoviruses, the hepatitis viruses, and the cancer-causing virus SV40. Context_4 : Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe is a 2016 American film alleging a cover-up by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of a purported link between the MMR vaccine and autism. According to ""Variety"", the film ""purports to investigate the claims of a senior scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who revealed that the CDC had allegedly manipulated and destroyed data on an important study about autism and the MMR vaccine""; critics derided it as an anti-vaccine propaganda film. Context_5 : Kreesten Meldgaard Madsen is a Danish epidemiologist and expert on infectious diseases who, as of 2003, worked at the Danish Epidemiology Science Centre at Aarhus University. He is known for leading two studies that found no link between either the MMR vaccine and autism or thimerosal and autism. The first of these studies pertained to MMR and was published in 2002; the second pertained to thimerosal and was published in 2003. Both of these studies received considerable media attention, but the study regarding thimerosal and autism was criticized by Mark Blaxill of activist group SafeMinds, who said it was irrelevant to the United States because it was conducted in Denmark, where the autism rate is lower. Context_6 : The MMR vaccine (also known as the MPR vaccine after the Latin names of the diseases) is an immunization vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles). It is a mixture of live attenuated viruses of the three diseases, administered via injection. It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman while at Merck. Context_7 : The MMR vaccine controversy started with the 1998 publication of a fraudulent research paper in ""The Lancet"" linking the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to colitis and autism spectrum disorders. The claims in the paper were widely reported, leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland and increases in the incidence of measles and mumps, resulting in deaths and severe and permanent injuries. Following the initial claims in 1998, multiple large epidemiological studies were undertaken. Reviews of the evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences, the UK National Health Service, and the Cochrane Library all found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Context_8 : Porter Warren Anderson, Jr. (born January 1, 1937) is an American microbiologist best known for developing a vaccine that protects children from infections by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and epiglottitis. The techniques he and his colleague Ronald Eby invented were later utilized to develop a vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Context_9 : Michelle Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, also known as the omnibus autism proceeding (OAP), was a court case involving the family of Michelle Cedillo, a girl with autism whose parents sued the United States government because they believed that her autism was caused by her receipt of both the measles-mumps-and-rubella vaccine (also known as the MMR vaccine) and thimerosal-containing vaccines. The omnibus proceeding required the petitioners to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, according to them, caused their children's autism; Michelle was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis. Context_10 : Mumpsvax is a mumps vaccine made of mumps virus. It is a product of Merck & Co., Inc.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.","Context_1 : The role of Australian women in World War I was focused mainly upon their involvement in the provision of nursing services. Australian women also played a significant role on the homefront, where they undertook fundraising and recruiting activities as well as organising comfort packages for soldiers serving overseas. Around the issue of conscription, women were involved in campaigning on both sides of the debate, while they were also equally involved in the New South Wales strike in 1917. Nevertheless, despite this involvement, women have never occupied a central position in the Australian version of the ANZAC myth, although since the 1970s their role has been examined in more detail as a result of the emergence of feminist historiography, and specialist histories such as the history of nursing. Context_2 : The history of tennis in New Zealand dates back to the 1870s, the decade when the development of modern tennis began. The first ""New Zealand Tennis Championships"" were played at Farndon in Hawkes Bay in 1886. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association (NZLTA) was formed at a meeting held in Hastings in December 1886. Shortly after its inauguration, the New Zealand Association became affiliated with the Lawn Tennis Association (England). In 1904 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association amalgamated with six Australian state tennis associations to form the Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association played a significant role in the origin of the Australian Open. Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia created the tournament called ""The Australasian Mens Championships"" (which later became Australian Open) in 1905 and was first played in Warehouseman's Cricket Ground and it was decided that championships would be hosted by both Australian as well as New Zealand venues. New Zealand hosted the championship twice— Christchurch (1906) and Hastings (1912). The geographical remoteness of both the countries (Australia and New Zealand) made it difficult for foreign players to enter the tournament. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended, and the tournament was won by a New Zealander (Tony Wilding). Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia was one of the twelve national associations of tennis which established the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) in a conference in Paris, France on 1 March 1913. From 1905 until 1919, New Zealand and Australian tennis players participated in the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (Davis Cup) under the alias of ""Team Australasia"", the team claimed a title six times (1907, 1908, 1909, 1911, 1914, 1919), however, there were attempts to severance this trans-tasmanian partnership, in order to allow New Zealand players to represent their nation on international tennis events. In 1922, New Zealand dropped out from this partnership and on 16 March 1923 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association was granted affiliation to the International Lawn Tennis Association and thereby became eligible to enter the International Lawn Tennis Challenge in its own right. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association filed its first challenge with United States Lawn Tennis Association for 1924 International Lawn Tennis Challenge. Tennis New Zealand was the founding member of Oceania Tennis Federation in 1993.

Context_2 : 4th & B'way Records (pronounced and spelled out completely as Fourth and Broadway Records in the UK) was a US-based subsidiary of Island Records that specialized in street-oriented music such as hip hop. Established in 1984, it was the flagship label of the Island Trading Company, the independent-distribution parent company of Island's other record labels that operated in the US.

Context_2 : Needed Truth is a Christian, Plymouth Brethren magazine that first appeared in 1888 in Scotland. The magazine discussed whether reception was to the Lord's Table, or if reception was to the assembly itself. This distinction had implications whether a believer from other evangelical churches could occasionally meet with the saints in a New Testament assembly.

Context_3 : Medieval women's mysticism was ""a succession of insights and revelations about God that gradually transformed the recipient"" according to historian Elizabeth Petroff of Oxford University in her 1994 book, ""Body and Soul."" The word ""mysticism"" has its origin in ancient Greece where individuals called the ""mystae"" participated in mystery religions. The life of a medieval woman mystic was spent seeking unity with God in a series of stages. The mystical life of a medieval woman began with a purge of the spirit in which she released herself from earthly indulgences and attachments. In a state of contrition the medieval woman mystic faced suffering because of her past sins, and the mercy of God was revealed to her through penitence. Mystics sought to imitate the suffering of Christ in order to gain an understanding through experience. During the compassion stage of suffering, the pain experienced by the medieval woman mystic ""revealed the believer's love of Christ, fostered unity with Christ and the world, and began to draw the believer beyond the physical Jesus who suffered on the Cross to understand the immensity of the love that motivated Christ in the world to suffer on humanity's behalf"". Medieval women mystics experienced visions during what medieval historians refer to as the Illuminative stage of their lives that contained instructions from God and would communicate their revelations in written form.

It is native to the Old World and is found from Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, Europe across to northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to southeast India. Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use, for use as culinary herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils. The most widely cultivated species, ""Lavandula angustifolia"", is often referred to as lavender, and there is a color named for the shade of the flowers of this species. Context_2 : Taro ( ) commonly refers to the plant ""Colocasia esculenta"", the most widely cultivated species of several plants in the Araceae family which are used as vegetables for their corms, leaves, and petioles. Thus, this article describes the ""dasheen"" form of taro; another variety of taro is known as eddoe or ""Colocasia antiquorum"". Other species of taro include giant taro (""Alocasia macrorrhizos""), swamp taro (""Cyrtosperma merkusii""), and arrowleaf elephant's ear (""Xanthosoma sagittifolium""). Context_3 : Xanthosoma is a genus of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae. The genus is native to tropical America but widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical regions. Several are grown for their starchy corms, an important food staple of tropical regions, known variously as ""malanga"", ""otoy"", ""otoe"", cocoyam (or new cocoyam), ""tannia"", ""tannier"", ""yautía"", ""macabo"", ""ocumo"", ""macal"", ""taioba"", ""dasheen"", ""quequisque"", ""ʻ ape"" and (in Papua New Guinea) as Singapore taro (""taro kongkong""). Many other species (including especially ""X. roseum"") are used as ornamental plants, and in popular horticultural literature are known as ‘ape or elephant ear (from the purported resemblance of the leaf to an elephant's ear), although the latter name is sometimes also applied to members with similar appearance and uses in the closely related genera ""Caladium"", ""Colocasia"" (i.e., taro), and ""Alocasia"".

It is Babbitt’s first published ensemble work, following shortly after his ""Three Compositions for Piano"" (1947). In both these pieces, Babbitt expands upon the methods of twelve-tone composition developed by Arnold Schoenberg. He is notably innovative for his application of serial techniques to rhythm. ""Composition for Four Instruments"" is considered one of the early examples of “totally serialized” music. It is remarkable for a strong sense of integration and concentration on its particular premises—qualities that caused Elliott Carter, upon first hearing it in 1951, to persuade New Music Edition to publish it (Carter 1976, 30). Context_2 : Milton Byron Babbitt (May 10, 1916 – January 29, 2011) was an American composer, music theorist, and teacher. He is particularly noted for his serial and electronic music.

Context_4 : Bethany Beardslee (born December 25, 1925) is an American soprano particularly noted for her collaborations with major 20th-century composers, such as Igor Stravinsky, Milton Babbitt, Pierre Boulez, George Perle, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and her performances of great contemporary classical music by Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, Anton Webern. Her legacy amongst midcentury composers was as a ""composer's singer""—for her commitment to the highest art of new music. Milton Babbitt said of her ""She manages to learn music no one else in the world can. She can work, work, work."" In a 1961 interview for Newsweek, Beardslee flaunted her unflinching repertoire and disdain for commercialism: ""I don't think in terms of the public... Music is for the musicians. If the public wants to come along and study it, fine. I don't go and try to tell a scientist his business because I don't know anything about it. Music is just the same way. Music is ""not"" entertainment."" Context_5 : Marjorie Ann Hess a.k.a. Maura Bosch (born 1958) is an American composer.

Context_7 : Composition for Twelve Instruments (1948, rev. 1954) is a serial music composition written by American composer Milton Babbitt for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, harp, celesta, violin, viola, cello, and double bass.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.","Context_1 : The Pyrenean Mountain Dog, known as the Great Pyrenees in North America, is a large breed of dog used as a livestock guardian dog. It should not be confused with the Pyrenean Mastiff. Context_2 : The Pyrenean Mastiff (Spanish:""Mastín del Pirineo"", Aragonese:""Mostín d'o Pireneu"") is a large breed of dog originally from the Aragonese Pyrenees in Spain. It should not be confused with the Pyrenean Mountain Dog. Context_3 : Rare breed (dog) is any breed of dog that is small in number and is used to refer to both old established breeds such as the Stabyhoun and Glen of Imaal Terrier or newer creations. Since dogs have greater genetic variability than other domesticated animals the number of possible breeds is vast with new crosses constantly occurring, from these both selected and random crosses may come new breeds should offspring reliably breed true to type. New breeds from the wild such as the Carolina Dog are quite rare compared to attempts at breed creation from man as found in the American Hairless Terrier which sought to exploit a mutation. Context_4 : The Stabyhoun or Stabij is one of the top five rarest dog breeds in the world. It is from Friesland and in particular from the Frisian forest area, a region in the southeast and east of Friesland. The breed has been mentioned in Dutch literature going back to the early 1800s, but has only extended its range from the 1960s outside of Friesland and not until the 2000s did the range officially extend beyond the Netherlands. The name Stabij translates roughly as ""stand by me"" with the last part simply Frisian, meaning dog, which is pronounced ""hoon"". The dog is considered a Dutch national treasure. There are only a few thousand Stabyhouns in existence today worldwide. Context_5 : The Dogue de Bordeaux, Bordeaux Mastiff, French Mastiff or Bordeauxdog is a large French Mastiff breed—and one of the most ancient French dog breeds. A typical brachycephalic molossoid type breed, the Bordeaux is a very powerful dog, with a very muscular body. This brawny breed has been put to work in many different capacities, from pulling carts and hauling heavy objects, to guarding flocks and, historically, the castles of the European elite. Context_6 : The Braques français are hunting dogs, from a very old type of gun dog used for pointing the location of game birds for a hunter. There are two breeds of Braque français, both from the south of France, the Braque français, type Gascogne (French Pointing Dog - Gascogne type, larger size) and the Braque français, type Pyrénées (French Pointing Dog - Pyrenean type, smaller size) They are popular hunting dogs in France, but are seldom seen elsewhere. Context_7 : Seven Royal Navy vessels have borne the name HMS ""Mastiff"", named after the mastiff, a type of dog: Context_8 : Mastiff type means a large molosser dog. The term ""mastiff type"" has been used synonymously with the term ""molosser"". For example, the bulldog breeds, the Great Dane, the mountain dogs, the pit bulls and even smaller dogs such as the Boston terrier, may be considered ""mastiff types"" in this broad sense. The descriptive term, mastiff type, should not be confused with the breed, the Mastiff. All breeds are individual and should be referred to by their breed name to ensure correct identification. Context_9 : The English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century. Distinguishable by enormous size, massive head, and a limited range of colours, but always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity. Throughout its history, the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as ""Mastiffs"". Context_10 : The Pyrenean donkey, French: Âne des Pyrénées , is a breed of domestic donkey from a large area of south-western of France, covering the whole of the regions of Aquitaine, Midi Pyrénées and Languedoc Roussillon. The largest concentration is in Aquitaine, which is a large part of the historic region of Gascony. The Pyrenean donkey breed unites two quite different types: the short and powerful Gascon type, and the taller and more elegant Catalan type, which is the French population of the Catalan donkey breed, approximately 20% of the total number of which is in the Roussillon. fact_1 : The Stabyhoun or Stabij is one of the top five rarest dog breeds in the world. fact_2 : The Pyrenean Mastiff (Spanish:""Mastín del Pirineo"", Aragonese:""Mostín d'o Pireneu"") is a large breed of dog originally from the Aragonese Pyrenees in Spain.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.","Context_1 : Plato's Problem is the term given by Noam Chomsky to ""the problem of explaining how we can know so much"" given our limited experience. Chomsky believes that Plato asked (using modern terms) how we should account for the rich, intrinsic, common structure of human cognition, when it seems undetermined by extrinsic evidence presented to a person during human development. In linguistics this is referred to as the ""argument from poverty of the stimulus"" (APS). Such arguments are common in the natural sciences, where a developing theory is always ""underdetermined by evidence"". Chomsky's approach to Plato's Problem involves treating cognition as a normal research topic in the natural sciences, so cognition can be studied to elucidate intertwined genetic, developmental, and biophysical factors. Plato's Problem is most clearly illustrated in the Meno dialogue, in which Socrates demonstrates that an uneducated boy nevertheless understands geometric principles. Context_2 : The Sound Pattern of English (frequently referred to as SPE) is a 1968 work on phonology (a branch of linguistics) by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle. It presents a view of the phonology of English, and has been very influential in both the field of phonology and in the analysis of the English language. Chomsky and Halle present a view of phonology as a linguistic subsystem, separate from other components of the grammar, that transforms an underlying phonemic sequence according to rules and produces as its output the phonetic form that is uttered by a speaker. The theory fits with the rest of Chomsky's early theories of language in the sense that it is transformational; as such it serves as a landmark in Chomsky's theories by adding a clearly articulated theory of phonology to his previous work which focused on syntax. Context_3 : Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (known in linguistic circles simply as ""Aspects"") is a book on linguistics written by American linguist Noam Chomsky, first published in 1965. In ""Aspects"", Chomsky presented a deeper, more extensive reformulation of transformational generative grammar (TGG), a new kind of syntactic theory that he had introduced in the 1950s with the publication of his first book, ""Syntactic Structures"". ""Aspects"" is widely considered to be the foundational document and a proper book-length articulation of Chomskyan theoretical framework of linguistics. It presented Chomsky's epistemological assumptions with a view to establishing linguistic theory-making as a formal (i.e. based on the manipulation of symbols and rules) discipline comparable to physical sciences, i.e. a domain of inquiry well-defined in its nature and scope. From a philosophical perspective, it directed mainstream linguistic research away from behaviorism, constructivism, empiricism and structuralism and towards mentalism, nativism, rationalism and generativism, respectively, taking as its main object of study the abstract, inner workings of the human mind related to language acquisition and production. Context_4 : ""Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship"" is the title of an essay by the American academic Noam Chomsky. It was first published as part of Chomsky's ""American Power and the New Mandarins"". Parts of the essay were delivered as a lecture at New York University in March 1968, as part of Albert Schweitzer Lecture Series. The first third of the essay, ""The Menace of Liberal Scholarship"" by Noam Chomsky in ""The New York Review of Books"", January 2, 1969, was taken ""almost verbatim"" from this essay. Context_5 : Avram Noam Chomsky ( ; born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist. Sometimes described as ""the father of modern linguistics,"" Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.

The company was bought by the American big box chain Kmart in 2005, which renamed itself Sears Holdings upon completion of the merger. In terms of domestic revenue, Sears was the largest retailer in the United States until October 1989, when Walmart surpassed the record. It is currently the fifth-largest American department store company by sales as of October 2013 (behind Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and The Home Depot), and the twelfth-largest retailer in the country overall. Sears operates divisions in Canada and Mexico, as well as several other subsidiaries within its brand.

Other discount department store retailers like K-Mart, Zayre, and Bradlees would subsequently expand on this concept. Context_3 : Woodward & Lothrop was a department store chain headquartered in Washington, D.C. Woodward & Lothrop was Washington, D.C.'s first department store, opening in 1887.

Eastern Hills Mall is part of a long commercial strip on Transit Road. It consists of two long wings running north and south and one short wing running east and west, which connects the north-south wings in a ""double L-shaped"" formation. A major department store is at the end of each wing. A food court is located adjacent to the end of the long south wing. A three-screen movie theater showing mainly independent films is also located in the mall, as well as a small New York State Department of Motor Vehicles office. Surrounding the mall is a large, but generally unkept, parking lot. The ratio of the mall is so large, it provides the highest parking ratio of any Buffalo area mall. Much of the parking lot space is leased to area car dealerships to store overstock vehicles due to the low volume of shoppers at the mall. Eastern Hills Mall is currently at approximately 70% occupancy, with many vacant stores throughout the mall and popular anchor store Dave & Busters shuttering its doors in 2015 to move to the nearby Walden Galleria. Eastern Hills is considered by many area residents to be a ""dead mall"" and is listed on the website Deadmalls.com. Most major and nationally recognized retailers have left and been replaced by independently owned ""mom-and-pop"" type stores, selling crafts and homemade goods.

It has yellow flowers, unlike the white or slightly pink flowers of true strawberries. It is native to eastern and southern Asia, but has been introduced to many other areas as an ornamental plant. It has been naturalized in many regions, including the southern United States, and is considered an invasive species in some regions. It is considered one of the most invasive plants on the island of Réunion. Context_2 : Greeks in Kyrgyzstan form one of the country's smaller minority groups. The existing data are contradictory. According to 2009 Census there are 451 Greeks. According to the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are 150 families of Greek origin (650–700 people). However, the data of the General Secretariat For Greeks Abroad give an even lower number (50 people). Context_3 : Kalimeris indica, also known as Indian aster or Indian Kalimeris, is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant of the family Asteraceae (Compositae). ""Kalimeris indica"", like other species in the genus of ""Kalimeris"", occurs mainly in eastern Asian countries of China, Korea and Japan, but has been introduced to California and Hawaii. Context_4 : The tribe Ormosieae is one of the subdivisions of the plant family Fabaceae, primarily found in tropical regions of the Americas, but also in southeast Asia and northern Australia. The members of this tribe were formerly included in tribe Sophoreae, but were recently circumscribed into a new tribe. The members of this tribe consistently form a monophyletic clade in molecular phylogenetic analyses. The tribe does not currently have a node-based definition, but morphological synapomorphies have been tentatively identified: ""mostly dehiscent pods with woody valves"" and ""tufts of minute colleter-like glands in the axils of bract and bracteoles"". Like other genistoids, members of tribe Ormosieae are known to produce quinolizidine alkaloids. Context_5 : Stylidium paniculatum is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the genus ""Stylidium"" (family Stylidiaceae). It is an herbaceous annual that grows from 10 to 35 cm tall. Oblanceolate or obovate leaves, about 6-30 per plant, form either a basal rosette with stems absent or in terminal rosettes when plant stems are present. The leaves are generally 10-31 mm long and 3-9 mm wide. This species produces one scape per plant. Inflorescences are 10-25 cm long and produce pink flowers that bloom from November to April in their native range. ""S. paniculatum"" is endemic to eastern Australia from Dalveen, Queensland to Tenterfield, New South Wales at elevations of 800 to 1000 metres. Its typical habitat has been reported as moist sandy soils on granite substrates along creeks, drains, or low-lying flats. ""S. paniculatum"" is closely related to ""S. debile"" and was originally described as a variety of ""S. debile"", but raised to the species level by Tony Bean in 1999. It differs from ""S. debile"" by the lack of bracteoles and its paniculate inflorescence. Its conservation status has been assessed as data deficient. Context_6 : Astyanax microschemos is a species of characid fish from Brazil. It belongs to the ""A. scabripinnis"" species complex and differs from other species outside it by having a lower number of branched anal fin rays (about 14-18 vs 20-45) and its shallow body depth being about 26.9-29.7 vs more than 35% of its standard length (SL). Compared to species of its own complex, it can be distinguished by the combination of its shallow body depth (ranging from 26.9-29.7% of SL), and smaller interorbital width (26.9-30.4% of its head length). The species name comes from the Greek ""mikroschemos"", meaning ""low stature"", which refers to the shallow body depth of the animal. Context_7 : Saraca indica, commonly known as asoka-tree, Ashok or simply Asoca, is a plant belonging to the Detarioideae subfamily of the Fabaceae family. The original plant specimen from which Carl Linnaeus described the species came from Java, but the name ""S. indica"" has been generally incorrectly applied to ""S. asoca"" since 1869. It can be distinguished from ""S. asoca"" by its non-clasping bracteoles, a lower number of ovules, slightly smaller pods, and a more eastern geographic distribution. Context_8 : Saraca asoca (the ashoka tree; lit., ""sorrow-less"") is a plant belonging to the Caesalpinioideae subfamily of the legume family. It is an important tree in the cultural traditions of the Indian subcontinent and adjacent areas. It is sometimes incorrectly known as ""Saraca indica"". Context_9 : The Syrian Democratic Forces (, Kurdish: ""Hêzên Sûriya Demokratîk""‎ , Syriac: ܚܝ̈ܠܘܬܐ ܕܣܘܪܝܐ ܕܝܡܩܪܛܝܬܐ‎ , ""Ḥaylawotho d'Suriya Demoqraṭoyto "" ), commonly abbreviated as SDF or QSD, are a multi-ethnic and multi-religious alliance of predominantly Kurdish but also Arab and Assyrian/Syriac militias, as well as some smaller Turkmen, Armenian, Circassian and Chechen groups/participation in the Syrian Civil War. The SDF is mostly composed of, and militarily led by, the People's Protection Units (YPG), a mostly Kurdish militia. According to the Pentagon, Kurds made up 40% of the SDF and Arabs 60% in March 2017, although other sources estimate the Arab components of the SDF to be at a significantly lower number. Founded in October 2015, the SDF states its mission as fighting to create a secular, democratic and federal Syria, along the lines of the Rojava Revolution in northern Syria. The updated December 2016 constitution of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria names the SDF as its official defence force. Context_10 : Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors. For example, it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved (underlying) variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables. The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus ""error"" terms. Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables. Followers of factor analytic methods believe that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Factor analysis is commonly used in biology, psychometrics personality theories, marketing, product management, operations research and finance. Users of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying/latent variables. It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality. fact_1 : Saraca indica, commonly known as asoka-tree, Ashok or simply Asoca, is a plant belonging to the Detarioideae subfamily of the Fabaceae family. fact_2 :  It can be distinguished from ""S. asoca"" by its non-clasping bracteoles, a lower number of ovules, slightly smaller pods, and a more eastern geographic distribution. fact_3 : Saraca asoca (the ashoka tree; lit., ""sorrow-less"") is a plant belonging to the Caesalpinioideae subfamily of the legume family.

Soviet troops seized and imprisoned more than half a million Japanese troops and civilians in China and other places. The number of Japanese soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen who surrendered was limited by the Japanese military indoctrinating its personnel to fight to the death, Allied combat personnel often being unwilling to take prisoners, and many Japanese soldiers believing that those who surrendered would be killed by their captors. Context_2 : During World War II, the Commissione Italiana d'Armistizio con la Francia (""Italian Armistice Commission with France"") or CIAF was a temporary civil and military body charged with implementing the Franco-Italian armistice of 24 June 1940 and harmonising it with the Franco-German armistice of 22 June. It had broad authority over the military, economic, diplomatic and financial relations between France and Italy until the Italo-German occupation of France (Operation A) on 11 November 1942. Thereafter its powers were gradually transferred to the Fourth Army, which was under the command of General Mario Vercellino and in occupation of southern France. The headquarters of the CIAF was in Turin and it was subordinate to the ""Comando Supremo"" (Italian supreme command). It liaised with the German Armistice Commission (""Waffenstillstandskommission"", WAKO) in Wiesbaden. Context_3 : The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyūjitai: 大日本帝國海軍 Shinjitai: 大日本帝国海軍 ""   "" or 日本海軍 ""Nippon Kaigun"", ""Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire"") was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 until 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and the Ministry of the Navy, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed after the dissolution of the IJN. Context_4 : Comfort bag (慰問袋, ""imon-bukuro"") was a gift packet prepared by civilians to be sent to Imperial Japanese Military soldiers for the purpose of encouraging them. The bag contains comfort articles (慰問品, ""imon-hin"") not issued by the Japanese Military, such as toiletries, dried fruits, canned foods, and letters of encouragement. Bags were prepared by schoolgirls or local patriotic women's societies. These activities were also made in Korea, which was then under Japanese rule, to encourage Korean soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Military. Context_5 : Japanese invasion money, officially known as Southern Development Bank Notes (Japanese: 大東亜戦争軍票 ""Dai Tō-A Sensō gunpyō"", ""Greater East Asia War military scrip""), was currency issued by the Japanese Military Authority, as a replacement for local currency after the conquest of colonies and other states in World War II. In February 1942 in Japan, laws were passed establishing the Wartime Finance Bank and the Southern Development Bank. Both institutions issued bonds to raise funds. The former loaned money primarily to military industries, but also to a wide range of other ventures, including hydroelectric generators, electric power companies, shipbuilding and petroleum. The latter provided financial services in areas occupied by the Japanese military, and Southern Development Bank notes were in fact used as de facto military scrip. In December 1942, the outstanding balance of Southern Development Bank notes stood at more than 470 million; in March 1945, more than 13 billion. Context_6 : John William Mitchell (14 July 1915 – 15 November 1995) was an officer of the United States Air Force, a flying ace and the leader of Operation Vengeance, the mission to shoot down Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. He served in World War II and the Korean War. Context_7 : Military Factions (軍閥 , Gunbatsu ) is a Japanese language term having two separate meanings. It is used to refer in the Japanese military in general, when it competed against the civilian leadership for control of the government’s domestic and foreign policy in the pre-World War II Empire of Japan. It is also used to refer to political factions or cliques within the Japanese military itself. The term came into common use in the Taishō period (1912-1926). Context_8 : The vulnerability of Japanese naval codes and ciphers was crucial to the conduct of World War II, and had an important influence on foreign relations between Japan and the west in the years leading up to the war as well. Every Japanese code was eventually broken, and the intelligence gathered made possible such operations as the victorious American ambush of the Japanese Navy at Midway (JN-25b) and the shooting down of Isoroku Yamamoto in Operation Vengeance. Context_9 : Operation ""Vengeance"" was the American military operation to kill Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto of the Imperial Japanese Navy on April 18, 1943, during the Solomon Islands campaign in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy, was killed on Bougainville Island when his transport bomber aircraft was shot down by United States Army Air Forces fighter aircraft operating from Kukum Field on Guadalcanal. Context_10 : The Sasanian army (Middle Persian ""Spâh-ī Sāsānīg"") was the primary military body of the Sasanian armed forces, serving alongside the Sasanian navy. The birth of the army dates back to the rise of Ardashir I (r. 224–241), the founder of the Sasanian Empire, to the throne. Ardashir aimed at the revival of the Persian Empire, and to further this aim, he reformed the military by forming a standing army which was under his personal command and whose officers were separate from satraps, local princes and nobility. He restored the Achaemenid military organizations, retained the Parthian cavalry model, and employed new types of armour and siege warfare techniques. This was the beginning for a military system which served him and his successors for over 400 years, during which the Sasanian Empire was, along with the Roman Empire and later the East Roman Empire, one of the two superpowers of Late Antiquity in Western Eurasia. The Sasanian army protected ""Eranshahr"" (""the realm of Iran"") from the East against the incursions of central Asiatic nomads like the Hephthalites and Turks, while in the west it was engaged in a recurrent struggle against the Roman Empire. fact_1 : Operation ""Vengeance"" was the American military operation to kill Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto of the Imperial Japanese Navy on April 18, 1943, during the Solomon Islands campaign in the Pacific Theater of World War II. fact_2 : The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyūjitai: 大日本帝國海軍 Shinjitai: 大日本帝国海軍 ""   "" or 日本海軍 ""Nippon Kaigun"", ""Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire"") was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 until 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II.

The opera made its first appearance at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice on 6 February 1813, and because ""Il signor Bruschino"" premiered in late January, the composer must have completed ""Tancredi"" in less than a month. The overture, borrowed from ""La pietra del paragone"", is a popular example of Rossini's characteristic style and is regularly performed in concert and recorded. Context_7 : Ivanhoé is an 1826 pastiche opera in three acts with music by Gioachino Rossini to a French-language libretto by Émile Deschamps and Gabriel-Gustave de Wailly, after Walter Scott's novel of the same name.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.","Context_1 : Typhoon Babe, also known as the Okinoerabu Typhoon (沖永良部台風 , Okinoerabu Taifū ) , was regarded as ""the worst typhoon to threaten Japan in 18 years."" Developing as a tropical depression on September 2, Babe initially tracked west-northwestward as it intensified. On September 5, an abrupt shift in steering currents caused the system to turn north-northwestward. Early on September 6, the system intensified into a typhoon. Over the following two days, Babe quickly intensified, ultimately attaining its peak intensity early on September 8 with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) and a barometric pressure of 905 mbar (hPa; 26.72 inHg). Not long after reaching this strength, another shift in the steering patterns caused the typhoon to execute a prolonged counter-clockwise arc, causing it to track through the Ryukyu Islands southwest of Japan, as it interacted with a low pressure originating from the Korean Peninsula. During this time, the system gradually weakened and eventually it made landfall near Shanghai, China on September 11 as a minimal typhoon before dissipating inland the following day. Coincidentally, Typhoon Babe and Atlantic Hurricane Babe existed at the same time from September 3–9. Context_2 : Typhoon Ike, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Nitang, was the deadliest typhoon of the 1984 Pacific typhoon season and crossed the Philippines in September. This tropical cyclone formed on August 27 in the Philippine Sea, and strengthened as it moved westward into the southern Philippines, becoming a typhoon on August 31. Typhoon Ike caused extreme wind and flooding damage when it crossed the Philippines, resulting in 1492 fatalities, one of the Philippines' worst natural disaster in modern times, and its worst typhoon since Amy struck the archipelago in 1951. A total of 200,000 to 480,000 were left homeless. Emerging from the Philippines as a strong tropical storm, Ike restrengthened as it tracked northwest through the South China Sea across northeast Hainan Island. Weakening back into a tropical storm, Ike moved inland into mainland China. In Hong Kong, winds gusted to 49 kn at Tate's Cairn. Extensive crop damage was experienced in southern China, with Ike becoming the most significant tropical cyclone to strike Guangxi since 1954. The total damage was reportedly US$111 million (1984 dollars). The name Ike was retired after this season. Typhoon Ike was recorded with a 220 km/h gust and an estimated 185 km/h msw in Surigao on September 2 and is one of the intense tropical cyclones and devastating and deadliest to hit the Philippines. Context_3 : Typhoon Gay, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Seniang, was the strongest and longest-lasting storm of the 1992 Pacific typhoon season. It formed on November 14 near the International Date Line from a monsoon trough, which also spawned two other systems. Typhoon Gay later moved through the Marshall Islands as an intensifying typhoon, and after passing through the country it reached its peak intensity over open waters. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 872 mb . However, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which is the official warning center in the western Pacific, estimated winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), with a pressure of 900 mbar . Gay weakened rapidly after peaking because of interaction with another typhoon, and it struck Guam with winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) on November 23. The typhoon briefly re-intensified before weakening and becoming extratropical south of Japan on November 30. Context_4 : Typhoon Shanshan, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Luis, was a strong typhoon that affected parts of East Asia in late September 2006. The 13th named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Typhoon Shanshan was also the seventh typhoon of the year operationally recognised by the Japan Meteorological Agency. In post-operational analysis Shanshan became the eighth typhoon of the year when Typhoon Maria was added to the list. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered Shanshan the 13th tropical storm and eighth typhoon of the season, a Category 4-equivalent typhoon in terms of 1-minute average wind speed. The name ""Shanshan"" was submitted to the naming list by Hong Kong and is a girls' given name. Context_5 : Typhoon Dot, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Saling, was the strongest storm of the 1985 season. Dot originated from a small area of thunderstorm activity in early to mid October. The system was first classified on October 11, and steadily intensified over the next few days. Dot attained typhoon strength on October 15, and subsequently entered a period of explosive deepening, which was not anticipated by forecasters. The next day the intensification rate slowed, but that evening, Dot attained its maximum intensify. A steady weakening trend began on October 17, though the system maintained typhoon intensity through the passage of the Philippines. After entering the South China Sea late on October 18, Dot briefly re-intensified, only to weaken as it approached Vietnam. On October 21, Dot struck Vietnam while still a typhoon, but dissipated the next day over the high terrain of the nation. Context_6 : The 1985 Pacific typhoon season has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1985, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names. Context_7 : Typhoon Nuri, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Karen, was the 12th named storm and the seventh typhoon that was recognised by the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center recognised it as the 13th tropical depression, the 12th tropical storm and the 8th typhoon of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season. The name Nuri was submitted to the World Meteorological Organisation's Typhoon Committee by Malaysia in 2003 after the name Rusa was retired in 2002. The name Nuri is Malay for a blue crowned parroquet, a type of parrot. The name Karen was assigned by PAGASA to a tropical depression for the second time, the other time being in 2004 to Typhoon Rananim. Context_8 : Typhoon Omar of 1992, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Lusing, was the strongest and costliest typhoon to strike Guam since Typhoon Pamela in 1976. The cyclone formed on August 23 from the monsoon trough across the western Pacific Ocean. Moving westward, Omar slowly intensified into a tropical storm, although another tropical cyclone nearby initially impeded further strengthening. After the two storms became more distant, Omar quickly strengthened into a powerful typhoon. On August 28, it made landfall on Guam with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). The typhoon reached its peak intensity the next day, with estimated 1‑minute winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), making it a ""super typhoon"" according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Omar weakened significantly before striking eastern Taiwan on September 4, proceeding into eastern China the next day and dissipating on September 9. Context_9 : Typhoon Dot, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Kuring, was one of several tropical cyclones to impact southern China and northern Vietnam during the 1989 Pacific typhoon season. Originating from a tropical disturbance near Palau on June 4, Dot tracked west-northwestward towards the Philippines. Crossing the country on June 6, the system moved over the South China Sea and attained typhoon status. Late on June 8, Dot reached its peak intensity with winds estimated at 185 km/h (115 mph). The system weakened slightly the next day before making landfall in Hainan Island. A weakened storm then entered the Gulf of Tonkin before striking northern Vietnam and dissipating on June 12. Context_10 : Typhoon Saomai, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Juan, was considered the most powerful typhoon on record to strike the east coast of the People's Republic of China. It was the eighth tropical storm, fifth typhoon, and third super typhoon of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season recognized by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, Saomai was the seventh tropical storm and fifth typhoon of the season. The name ""Saomai"" was submitted by Vietnam, and is from the Vietnamese word for ""morning star"" (""sao Mai""), a reference to the planet Venus. fact_1 : Typhoon Dot, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Saling, was the strongest storm of the 1985 season. fact_2 :  Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. fact_3 :  This can often result in the same storm having two names.
