If you have a two-storey foyer, hang the chandelier about one-third of the way between ceiling and floor. When placing pendants in a row, the space between the bulbs or light sources (not the edges of the fixture themselves) should be about 30″ apart. 5. Should I use a dimmer? The lighting industry's standard recommendation for sizing a dining room chandelier is that the diameter of the fixture should be one-half to two-thirds the width of the dining table. Another way to size a fixture is to choose a diameter that is 1 foot smaller than the table width. [Image Credit] 1  Dining Rooms.

If you have the standard 5-foot-wide hallway, opt for a chandelier with a 12-inch diameter. The distance between the floor and the bottom of the chandelier should be between 80 and 84 inches. Hold the chain or cord from which the light hangs at various heights over the table, while a friend sits at a table and views the ambient light. Opt for what looks and feels best with that particular fixture, considering the height of the table and chairs, so your diners won't bump into the fixture while they're eating. Once you've picked out a pendant light or set of lights to hang above a bar, determining the ideal hanging height for the lighting may seem a bit confusing at first. In general, 30 to 40 inches of air space between counter and the bottom of the pendant allows enough room to avoid bumping into the lights while also providing ample light. The ideal distance for your particular setup may vary based on the heights of guests using the bar, seated or standing. 96: If you're looking to add drama and interest to your staircase, hanging a light fixture is the perfect way to do just that -- especially in a larger home with a grand staircase that spans several floors. Assuming your table is 30 high, the bottom of your light fixture will be about 60 from the floor. AFF (meaning Above Finished Floor).

For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. At 3%, calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the third most abundant metal behind aluminium and iron. It is also the fourth most abundant element in the lunar highlands. Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air. Its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the Calcium has four basic functions in the soil which help to create better soil structure and healthy plants. Calcium is an alkaline metal of Group II A on the periodic chart and is the fifth most abundant element in the earth's crust while being widely distributed in nature.

Calcium (Ca), chemical element, one of the alkaline-earth metals of Group 2 (IIa) of the periodic table. It is the most abundant metallic element in the human body and the fifth most abundant element in Earth’s crust. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca 2+ concentration is not constant, and that the ocean is never in a steady state with respect to calcium input and output. This has important climatological implications, as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the carbon cycle. Calcium is the fifth most abundant chemical element in Earth’s crust. It also makes up 2 percent of the human body. In the body calcium helps form bones and teeth and keeps them healthy. It is also present in the blood and in nerve cells.

These studies are of interest to me because I have been under treatment for the past two years for gingivitis, or inflammatory gum disease. Cranial nerves connect your sense organs (eyes, ears, nose, mouth) to your brain; Central nerves connect areas within the brain and spinal cord; Peripheral nerves connect the spinal cord with your limbs; Autonomic nerves connect the brain and spinal cord with your organs (heart, stomach, intestines, blood vessels, etc.) The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord, including cranial and central nerves. In another study, New York University dental researchers studied people from 50-70 years of age, and were able to link inflamed gums to a greatly increased risk of cognitive impairment. It seems that the pathogens connected with inflamed gums can generate inflammation in the brain cells, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. There are numerous thoughts on the causes of dementia, but staying on top of dental problems is one of the easiest ways to lower your chances of developing this devastating diagnosis.

(In fact, Neptune is currently the farthest planet from the Sun‹since the early 1970s, Pluto has been closer to the Sun than Neptune has, and it will remain so until the end of this century.) * At this distance, Neptune receives nearly 1,000 times less sunlight than Earth, and about two and one-half times less than Uranus, but its overall temperature is about the same as that of Uranus. 1,500-M.P.H. Winds Found on Neptune THE ASSOCIATED PRESS AN FRANCISCO -- Neptune is swept by 1,500 mile-an-hour winds, the fastest yet discovered in the solar system, scientists have determined from analyzing photographs taken by Voyager 2. It is estimated that the wind speed on Neptune could exceed 2,000 mph. Also, It's estimated to 1,000 miles to 2,000 miles. It is estimated that the wind speed on Neptune could exceed 2,000 mph. Also, It's estimated to 1,000 miles to 2,000 miles. The scientists discovered the winds blow in relatively thin weather layers no more than 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) deep on both planets. For comparison, Neptune is about 30,600 miles (49,250 km) in diameter, while Uranus is approximately 31,500 miles (50,700 km) wide. These findings help reveal how these winds originate, researchers said. Quick Answer. Neptune takes 19 hours to complete its spin. It takes 165 Earth years to make one orbit around the sun, which equates to one year on Neptune. Neptune is the eighth planet in the solar system, and it is at an average distance of 2.8 billion miles from the sun. Nothing on Jupiter remains the same. In terms of size growth, it can't really grow in latitude, as it is bound by Jupiter's zonal winds. That can change slightly, and it could expand in longitude, though we haven't seen them ever really do that (both the GRS and predecessor ovals have shrunk in longitudinal extent over the years). Started wondering about the speed of sound on Neptune when I heard winds there can reach in excess of 1500+ mph, well above Earth's speed of sound. According to this report, the speed of sound could range from 600-740 m/s or 1350-1650 mph on Neptune. What happens when wind speed break the sound barrier? Would these storms create a sonic boom effect? May 17, 2013. This image of Neptune was taken during the August 16-17, 1989, period as Voyager 2 photographed the planet almost continuously, but had no way to measure the winds or how deep they reach into the atmosphere. Now, scientists have turned to subtle changes in the planet's gravity for clues. Best Answer: Neptune also has 2,500 km/h winds of hydrogen, helium, and methane that gives the planet its blue appearance. Neptune weather is characterized by extremely violent hurricanes, whose winds reach 1,000 mph. winds on neptune blow 10 times than the earth's (or 700 m/second), in fact, neptune has the great dark spot in which storms whirls like swirling clouds. hadouken07 · 1 decade ago 0 Query: how fast can the winds on neptune","Neptune has 2,500 km/h of winds.","Nothing on Jupiter remains the same.

Pain that starts to get worse after two days is considered abnormal and you may want to see your dentist. This could be a sign of “dry socket”. Dry Socket. A dry socket occurs when the blood clot for healing becomes dislodged or doesn’t form. In that case, the bone and fine nerve endings are not protected and exposed to air, food, and liquids. Dry socket delays the healing process and can be very painful. If you suspect dry socket, see your dentist. For example, after evaluating the outcome of 400 wisdom tooth extractions, Sweet (1979) [page references] determined that: Patients who smoked 10 cigarettes a day experienced a more than fourfold rate of dry socket formation (12% vs 2.6%). The rate for patients who smoked 20 cigarettes daily was 20% higher. If the extracted tooth is shallow-rooted premolar, an incisor or a canine, and it has no major infection, an immediate implant placement can be performed. If the extracted tooth is a molar with a healthy supporting bone, an immediate-delayed implant placement procedure (about two weeks to three months) can be performed. If the extracted tooth has a bone loss from disease in the gum, then a delayed or late implant (three months or more after tooth extraction) can be conducted.Learn more about Dental. Here are some correlations: 1  Having a back tooth pulled (especially a molar) typically poses a greater risk than a front tooth. 2  The risk of dry socket formation is 10 times higher when a lower tooth is extracted, as opposed to an upper one. It can be painful for days while the body walls off and isolates the dead bone. The answer to your question is that there is always a risk of getting a dry socket if the blood clot is disturbed, and that risk continues with decreasing likelihood for the twenty one days while wound healing and closure occurs. If you are a regular tobacco user refrain from smoking for the next 3-4 days as smoking increases your chances of getting a dry socket as well as an infection. After your tooth has been extracted, healing will take some time. Within 3 to 14 days, your sutures should fall out or dissolve. For sutures that are non-resorbable, your doctor will schedule a follow-up appointment to remove the stitches for you. The first thing I did after I got 2 teeth extracted was to go to friends house and smoke weed. The effect anesthesia was fading and weed really helped. I also smoked the next day after getting 2 other teeth extracted. Nothing happened. I had no idea about this thing called dry socket and am happy I didn't get it. If I knew, I might not have smoked. Pain alone is not necessarily an indication that you have a dry socket. However, if you feel increased pain two days after the surgery in addition to other dry socket symptoms, your socket is probably dry. Usually, a dry socket heals itself after five days and the pain disappears. I haven't because I don't want the dry sockets.

Most major carpet manufacturers like Philadelphia Shaw contest that Hot Water Extraction is the most effective carpet cleaning method on the market, as well as the least harmful to you and your family's health. Wait about an hour, then vacuum. 1  Wait until HOST is completely dry (about an hour) and then simply vacuum. 2  HOST will lighten to a pale gold color as it dries. 3  Since HOST is all natural and safe for people and pets, you can use your room while it’s drying. 4  After vacuuming, a trace of HOST may remain in the carpet. A carpet cleaner is designed to force a mixture of hot water and cleaning solution into the carpet to clean deep down. The solution and dirt are then extracted from the carpet, leaving the fibers and carpet base clean. Vacuums, even the best ones, simply can't reach the deep-down dirt at the base of your carpet's fibers. The carpet cleaning process is engineered to reach the dirt vacuums leave behind. Incidentally, although carpet cleaning does so much more than vacuuming, the actual work process itself is about as easy as vacuuming. How long will it take my carpet to dry after deep cleaning? Drying time will vary by the type of carpet, thickness of the pad and the cleaning techniques of the user. On average, it's best to wait four to six hours before walking on the carpet after carpet cleaning. In all modesty, we pioneered the category.

So if you have more than one spot that needs spackling. Do the first coat on all the spots at the same time and repeat the second and third coats for all the spots. Usually you can go around and hit all the spots in a room in a few minutes. Any professional plasterer would in no way use one coat plaster. The reasons being that you will never get the true fine finish that is required and will usually get the finish that you have received. Personally, I would always with no exceptions 2 coat any room, wall or even drywall repair. My working week is quite long, even by a plasterer’s standards. On a typical day, I will begin by putting down the dust sheets.

Plant onions sets (small bulblets) 3 to 4 months before the time you want to harvest mature bulbs; plant sets 3 to 4 weeks before you want to harvest green onions. Onion seeds are best started indoors: start seeds 4 to 6 weeks before the average last frost date in spring, and transplant them into the garden as soon as the soil can be worked. Lancastrian is a football shaped onion, that is crisp, sweet, 95 days to maturity. Copra is an early onion, with a medium size bulb, dark yellow skins, 104 days to maturity. Ailsa Craig Exhibition is a hugh, round, white, mild onion with yellow skins, 110 days to maturity. First edition is a medium size onion, yellow skins, 105 days to maturity. Short-day varieties of onions such as the Texas Supersweet that are grown in the South take 80 to 95 days to mature from seed. Long-day varieties such as Spanish onions that are grown in the North take 105 to 120 days to mature. For areas with shorter growing seasons, onion seeds can been sown indoors and transplanted at eight weeks. It is my first year trying onions, and have started both scallions and yellow onions from seed, indoors. They are in small plastic seed starting trays and growing under lights at about 75 degrees Farenheit. When starting seeds of other garden crops indoors under lights, the lights should be left on for 18-24 hours per day, but having them on that long for onion seedlings can affect the bulb set. Instead, leave them on for only about 12 hours per day. Plant onion seeds in clean nursery flats using sterile, seed-starting potting mix. The onion is a bulb-forming plant with long, tubular, deep, rich green leaves. They vary in size from the tiny green or spring onions to the large sweet Bermuda-type onion. Colors are white, yellow, and red. Bulb onions mature in response to changing amounts of daylight. The longer the plants grow before forming bulbs, the bigger and better those bulbs will be. In North America, days become shorter after the summer solstice (June 21st). Plants take around 100+ days to mature, so you'll need to better part of 4 months to get full grown onions, although the bulbs can be harvested before they are fully mature.

Because the Columbine incident was something new, it prompted new thinking by police depart-ments about how they should respond. More than a decade later, this process of developing new police policies, practices, and training for “active shooter” events is continuing. Introduction “Columbine was a wake-up call.” —Montgomery County, MD Police Chief Thomas Manger Data from 2012 shows the average response time is 9.1 minutes. That's the longest response time since 2003, and the wait time has been increasing every year. Dallas. Violent crime is on the rise, as is the response time. As of Augut 2015, average response time sits at more than 8 minutes. The results were not good. The suspects were able to get their first shot off at the officer in an average of just 0.38 seconds. The highly trained officers lagged behind with an average time to first shot of 0.39 seconds. If you believe 0.01 seconds to be an insignificant measurement, look at it this way: the study showed the inexperienced suspects shot first or exactly tied the highly trained and experienced officers 60% of the time.

Angie M. Tarighi is the CEO & Founder of Women's Self-Defense Institute and has been teaching women's self-defense programs for over 20 years. The average response time for Priority 1 calls, which represent a life-threatening situation requiring an immediate response, such as a bank robbery or sexual assault in progress, was about 10 minutes and 40 seconds in 2011. Response times for Priority 1 calls have jumped by two minutes since then. Factors that make response time slower: 1  Living in a remote area (response times may be > 30 minutes) 2  Your city requires an alarm permit. In some localities, not having a valid alarm permit means that the police won’t ever respond to your alarm. 3  The alarm is unverified. I must point out that police response is much faster for a personal emergency situation in progress, such as a panic button activation or a cell phone call being made by a homeowner directly to 9-1-1 during a break-in.

Over time, a coronary artery can narrow from the buildup of various substances, including cholesterol (atherosclerosis). This condition, known as coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks. Although a heart attack is a frightening event, if you learn the signs of a heart attack and what steps to take, you can save a life—perhaps even your own. Many people think that heart attacks are a “man’s problem,” yet heart disease is actually the number one killer of both men and women in the United States. To diagnose a heart attack, an emergency care team will ask you about your symptoms and begin to evaluate you. The diagnosis of the heart attack is based on your symptoms and test results. The goal of treatment is to treat you quickly and limit heart muscle damage. Tests to Diagnose a Heart Attack. ECG . Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men. What is cardiac arrest? About every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Your heart muscle needs oxygen to survive. A heart attack occurs when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart muscle is severely reduced or cut off completely (View an animation of blood flow). Several studies have demonstrated that there is seasonal variation in heart attacks. They are most likely to occur in the winter, and least likely to occur in the summer. This is not just true for heart attacks, but also other cardiovascular events. Several explanations have been proposed. Heart attacks may seem like a senior citizen phenomenon, considering that about 82% of people who die of coronary heart disease are at least 65, according to the American Heart Association. But sudden heart problems can occur much earlier in life, too. Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a heart attack. 1. A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, occurs when a part of the heart muscle doesn’t receive enough blood flow. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart muscle.

Its level goes down slowly, consequently, the remnants of the hormone are still present in the body sometimes for months after miscarriage. Other Causes of Two Strips After Miscarriage. Woman adheres to a diet. Pregnancy after miscarriage: What you need to know. Pregnancy after miscarriage can be stressful and confusing. When is the best time to get pregnant? What are the odds of miscarrying again? Get the facts about pregnancy after miscarriage. By Mayo Clinic Staff 120 comments. 1  I had an abortion two weeks ago. I don’t have any symptoms of pregnancy. 2  Thanks a lot, because yesterday I went again for the ultra sound of which they said the scan shows no pregnancy and the doctor put in the fingers inside my vagina, she said the cervix is closed I have no blood so she doesn’t see any pregnancy. In some cases, the hCG levels can return to the normal level within just a few days after a miscarriage. In some other cases, the hCG levels may take a few weeks to return to the normal level after a miscarriage. Here are a few things that will help you understand the changes better: Not true all the time. I had a miscarriage, and 2 weeks later ovulated and became pregnant. I read that your HCG levels have to go back down to 0 for you to even ovulate. The doctors thought I was pregnant due to remnants too, but had my blood taken and at 3 weeks pregnant, they were over 250. positive pregnancy tests after miscarriage. I think I know the answers to this really but I need a bit of hand-holding. Last week I was 6 weeks pregnant but then had a lot of bleeding and pain. GP said miscarriage, and that I should do another pregnancy test this week to confirm. I asked him what to do if it was positive, and he said 'well I really think it will be negative'. Well, it was a strong positive. If you have stopped bleeding chances are your hcg level is returning to normal. If you had normal periods before, you could probably expect to ovulate 2 - 3 weeks after the miscarriage, and a period about 5 weeks after. Good luck! The bleeding slowed and then came back heavy again. After bleeding for two weeks straight, it lightened. Now I think it is finally over. I took another P.T. tonight to see if the HCG was finally out. It was faintly positive...so i will have to wait a bit longer. How the miscarriage occurred, such as spontaneous miscarriage or medical procedure, can also affect how fast hCG levels decrease. In general, hCG levels return to normal by 4 to 6 weeks after a miscarriage, but they may occur sooner during the very early stages of pregnancy. Placental Causes of High hCG After a miscarriage, hCG levels can sometimes remain elevated. It depends: How long for hcg to go down depends on how high it was and whether the miscarriage is complete or not. Pregnancy test is not a good way to know, since it can remain positive for many weeks after a miscarriage. ...Read more Query: how long is hcg positive after miscarriage",It takes 4 to 6 weeks for HCG levels return to normal after miscarriage.,"The hormone HCG is the reason of everything.

As a commercial driver in the trucking industry, you may never have to sit behind a desk. A: Yes, they are free to you as long as you drive for the sponsoring company for a few months. The cost is covered by a big trucking company. They need new drivers and you need a new driving career, so it's a win-win situation. Here is a list of most not-company-sponsored truck driving schools. Most people who want to become commercial drivers choose to get their training at local truck driving schools. But another option exists—one that allows you to get paid while you learn. Through company-sponsored CDL training, you can learn how to drive commercial vehicles at no cost to you. Below is a basic breakdown of the difference between the three levels. 1  A CDL-A allows you to operate a commercial vehicle with a trailer where the trailer weighs more than 10,000 lbs. and the combined weight of the vehicle and trailer exceeds 26,001 lbs. when fully loaded. Note that most truck drivers are paid by the mile, and regulations only allow for 70 hours of driving within an eight-day period. There are also additional regulations for how those 70 hours are used (such as requirements for rest breaks, etc).**. Q: Is there any difference between truck driving school and CDL training? A: Yes, there is a big difference. In school, you pretty much learn some very basic maneuvers and get your commercial driver’s license Class A (or CDL Class A). In training, you go out on the road with a driver trainer (or mentor) and learn all the ins and outs of the trucking business. Q: How long is truck driving school and how long is CDL training? A: Most of these truck driving schools are three weeks. Driver training is about four to eight weeks. Q: What are the minimum requirements to get into a company-sponsored driving school? How Long Is Truck Driving School? Programs vary significantly in length. At some schools, CDL training takes only three to five weeks. But at others, it can take eight to ten weeks or as long as 20 to 24 weeks. How long a program lasts is often determined by the depth and breadth of the in-classroom curriculum as well as the amount of on-the-road training. Instructors do not need certification to start working as a truck driving instructor. Most schools require new instructors to have a valid commercial driver's license and two to three years of truck driving experience. After you gain enough teaching experience and pass enough tests to meet certification requirements, you pay a $50 fee to become certified. This fee applies to all certification levels. From one CDL truck driving school to another, training programs can vary quite a bit. Some of the differences that you might encounter include: What is included with your tuition—Some CDL driving schools offer inclusive tuition, meaning that most of the expenses related to becoming a licensed truck driver are covered. The field portion of your truck driver training can familiarize you with the following: 1  Pre- and post-trip inspections. 2  Trip planning and mapping. 3  In-cab instruments and controls. 4  Safe driving practices. 5  Backing up. 6  Shifting. 7  And much more.

That's more or less how digital radio works! 1  The transmitter sends program signals broken into fragments and coded in numbers (digits). 2  The transmitter sends each fragment many times to increase the chances of it getting through. It's simple. Radio waves travel unbelievably fast—at the speed of light (300,000 km or 186,000 miles per second). Analog radio. Ocean waves carry energy by making the water move up and down. In much the same way, radio waves carry energy as an invisible, up-and-down movement of electricity and magnetism. The electromagnetic energy, which is a mixture of electricity and magnetism, travels past you in waves like those on the surface of the ocean. These are called radio waves. Like ocean waves, radio waves have a certain speed, length, and frequency. The speed is simply how fast the wave travels between two places. The wavelength is the distance between one crest (wave peak) and the next, while the frequency is the number of waves that arrive each second.

Notably, the detection of influenza viral RNA by these assays does not necessarily indicate detection of viable infectious virus or on-going influenza viral replication. It is important to note that not all assays have been cleared by the FDA for diagnostic use. The signs and symptoms of influenza can vary by age, immune status, and presence of underlying medication conditions. Uncomplicated influenza can include any or all of these signs and symptoms: fever, muscle aches, headache, lack of energy, dry cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, and possibly runny nose. Dr. Robert Vanzant used the quick test for flu in January and February, but he never expected to bring it out again as we head into summer. This is not flu season, so if someone has the flu this time of year we have to consider swine flu, said Dr. Van Zant, a family practice physician. He demonstrated the flu quick test for us by sticking a cotton swab up both nostrils. Both sides and it's gonna tickle. I'm digging for china here, said Dr. Vanzant. After swabbing both nostrils, the swab sits in liquid for a minute, then the test strip goes in and results come back in 10 minutes. It's the same technology that's used for the home pregnancy test, said Dr. Vanzant. Our test is negative, but other tests are examples of what a positive test looks like. Among respiratory specimens for viral isolation or rapid detection of human influenza viruses, nasopharyngeal specimens typically have higher yield than nasal or throat swab specimens. As with any diagnostic test, results should be evaluated in the context of other clinical and epidemiologic information available to health care providers. Preferred respiratory samples for influenza testing include nasopharyngeal or nasal swab, and nasal wash or aspirate, depending on which kind of test is used . Rapid Influenza Testing. The diagnostic accuracy of influenza swabs is often overestimated by clinicians. The CDC notes that rapid influenza testing has a sensitivity ranging from approximately 50% to 70% — meaning that in up to half of influenza cases, the flu swab results will still be negative. Another study in Turkey showed that the sensitivity of rapid influenza testing for H1N1 ranged from 31.7% to 50%, again depending on the brand of test. During a respiratory illness outbreak in a closed setting (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facility, cruise ship, boarding school, summer camp) testing for influenza can be very helpful in determining if influenza is the cause of the outbreak. So how sensitive are they for “flu-like illness”? Rapid Influenza Testing The diagnostic accuracy of influenza swabs is often overestimated by clinicians. The CDC notes that rapid influenza testing has a sensitivity ranging from approximately 50% to 70% — meaning that in up to half of influenza cases, the flu swab results will still be negative. Preferred respiratory samples for influenza testing include nasopharyngeal or nasal swab, and nasal wash or aspirate, depending on which kind of test is used (see table(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/table-testing-methods.htm)). Samples should be collected within the first 3-4 days of illness. Laboratory Diagnostic Procedures. A number of tests can help in the diagnosis of influenza (see table(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/table-testing-methods.htm)). But, tests do not need to be done on all patients with suspected influenza. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) provide results within approximately 15 minutes; viral culture provides results in 3-10 days. Most of the rapid influenza diagnostic tests that can be done in a physician’s office are approximately 50-70% sensitive for detecting influenza and approximately greater than 90% specific.

The test will yield a positive result when concentrations of morphine exceed 2000 ng/mL. Morphine is excreted unmetabolized (aka unchanged), and is also the major metabolic product of codeine and heroin. Fentanyl is one of the strongest opiates available today. Fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and over 100 times stronger than morphine. Due to this, it is typically prescribed to patients with an injury, who are experiencing severe pain, or after a patient has undergone surgery. Interpretation. 1  Opiates are the natural or synthetic drugs that have a morphine-like pharmacological action. 2  Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is a synthetic opiate made from morphine and is rarely detectable in body fluids. 3  Ingestion of bakery products containing poppy seeds can also cause morphine to be excreted in urine. If excessively large amounts are consumed, this can result in urine morphine concentrations up to 2000 ng/mL for a period of 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Due to first-pass metabolism, no pharmacologic effect is experienced from poppy seed ingestion. Till date, it is used widely along with morphine to sedate a person and dull severe pain. Opium is also one of the most abused substances in the world today. What are Opiates? Opiates are a class of drugs which are derived from opium. The principle alkaloid of this class of drugs is morphine, which is also one the most widely used painkillers as well as most abused drug. Even in the times of ancient Sumerians, the chemical properties of opium and its effects on the brain were known and studied. A: Morphine generally is detectable in blood for up to 12 hours after use, in saliva for up to four days, in urine for up to three or four days and in hair follicles for up to 90 days, according to About Health.

The third table lists five common classes of drugs and information related to their detection in a urine drug test (i.e., primary metabolites, typical detection cut-off, potential sources of false positives, The most commonly used opiates are heroin, hydrocodone, morphine, and codeine. Heroin is a particularly fast-acting drug with a very short half-life. A saliva test will only be able to detect heroin for the first 5 hours after the last dose, and blood tests work for an average of 6 hours. Morphine is the most abundant opiate derived from the opium plant. With hundreds of brand names, morphine is an analgesic drug that acts directly on the central nervous system.

As the adjacent diagram illustrates, each of the types of rocks is altered or destroyed when it is forced out of its equilibrium conditions. An igneous rock such as basalt may break down and dissolve when exposed to the atmosphere, or melt as it is subducted under a continent. Due to the driving forces of the rock cycle, plate tectonics and the water cycle, rocks do not remain in equilibrium and are forced to change as they encounter new environments. The rock cycle is an illustration that explains how the three rock types are related to each other, and how processes change from one type to another over time. This cyclical aspect makes rock change a geologic cycle and, on planets containing life, a biogeochemical cycle During the rock cycle process, sedimentary rocks can become metamorphic or igneous rocks as they are buried in the planet's crust with younger layers of rock above them. Eventually they can metamorphose under heat and pressure at great depth, or melt to form new magma. Uplifting of rock layers by earth forces can bring rocks near the surface again at any point in the cycle. Igneous and metamorphic rocks can weather to form sediments that later become sedimentary rocks. Igneous rocks can metamorphose when subjected again to heat and pressure. Metamorphic rocks can metamorphose in repeat episodes or melt into magma, which later cools to form igneous rocks. Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill. It has a composition similar to gabbro. The difference between basalt and gabbro is that basalt is a fine-grained rock while gabbro is a coarse-grained rock. Basalt (pronounced /bəˈsɔːlt/, /ˈbæsɒlt/ or /ˈbæsɔːlt/) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows. A: Basalt is primarily formed by the extrusion of lava flows onto the surface of the earth during a volcanic eruption. The intrusion of a narrow sill or igneous dike below the crust also results in the formation of basalt. Basalt is a type of igneous rock that is typically dark in coloration with a fine-grained texture. It is the most predominant rock type found in Earth's crust, and mainly consists of pyroxene and plagioclase minerals. Volcanoes that form basalt are commonly found near the ocean basins. IGNEOUS ROCKS (obsidian, granite, scoria, basalt) - all samples seem to be hard and not breakable. GRANITE: Granite is an igneous rock that cooled very slowly. We know this because the minerals in granite are very large. It takes a long time (hundreds of thousands of years) for rocks to grow to visible size. BASALT: Basalt cooled more quickly than granite. A type of igneous rock. Basalt is the most common rock type in the earth's crust and makes up most of the ocean floor. A process that turns sediment into sedimentary rock. Over time, sediment accumulates in oceans, lakes, and valleys, eventually building up in layers and weighing down the material underneath. Molten rock that flows beneath the earth's surface and is made up of gases, liquids, and crystals. When magma reaches the surface, it is called lava. Marble A type of metamorphic rock formed when limestone is pushed down into the earth and subjected to intense heat and pressure for a long period of time. Melting dating: The global tectonic rock cycle …that allow black lava, called basalt, to reach the surface. The portion that remains in a fissure below the surface usually forms a vertical black tubular body known as a dike (or dyke). Basalt Rocks Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock that is very dark in color. It is the most common type of rock in the Earth's crust and it makes up most of the ocean floor. It is made of many dark colored minerals such as pyroxene and olivine. Basalt also contains some light colored minerals such as feldspar and quartz, but the amounts are small.

Iodine test for starch the most followed method to analyze the presence of starch in the given food material. When iodine solution is mixed with starch it turns from brown to dark blue. As this happens with very small amounts of starch, iodine test is a sensitive one. Testing for starch. Glucose is sweet and dissolves in water while starch is not sweet and does not dissolve well in water. A further test to distinguish starch from glucose is to shine a beam of light through ‘solutions’ of each. This is also called the Tyndall Beam Effect. Dispersal only happens in starch as the large starch molecules are big enough to affect the light. This is a physical test. A chemical test for starch is to add iodine solution (red) and see if it turns blue/black in colour. It is possible to distinguish starch from other carbohydrates using this iodine solution test. For example, if iodine is added to an peeled potato then it will turn black. You could demonstrate the effect of iodine solution on starch by adding a few drops of solution to a starch powder or starch suspension in a boiling tube. You can then discuss the fact that this colour change might be hard to see in a dark green leaf until the chlorophyll is removed. The iodine turned from a red/yellow colour to a blue-black colour.

Ladybugs make a chemical that smells and tastes bad so predators won’t eat them. Ladybugs hibernate in large groups in cold weather. Many countries consider a ladybug to be a sign of good luck. Eggs hatch in three to five days, and larvae feed on aphids or other insects for two to three weeks, then pupate. Adults emerge in seven to ten days. There may be five to six generations per year. In the autumn, adults hibernate, sometimes in large numbers, in plant refuse and crevices. The life cycle of the ladybug is between four to six weeks. In the spring the adults lay up to three hundred eggs in an aphid colony. The eggs hatch in two to five days. The newly hatched larvae feed on aphids for up to three weeks, and then they enter the pupa stage. The adult ladybug emerges about a week later. However, they usually do not have their spots for their first 24 hours of adulthood. So, if you catch one in your schoolyard without spots, you may have found a brand new adult. There may be as many as six generations of ladybugs hatched in a year. Ms. Frizzle: In the olden days, British farmers prayed to the Virgin Mary for help with their crops. Then ladybugs arrived and helped the farmers by eating crop-eating bugs and saved farmers' crops. In honor of these bugs, the farmers called the beetles Our Lady's beetle, which turned into ladybug.

Despite lackluster customer support, a wide range of plans and fast overall speeds make Xfinity from Comcast a suitable choice for internet service. Customers who currently subscribe to many popular Xfinity bundles will now automatically be upgraded to either Performance Pro, increasing their download speeds from 75 Mbps to 100 Mbps, or Blast Pro, increasing their speeds from 150 Mbps to 200 Mbps. When I was sold my bundle, I was told that I would get 75 mbs speed with my Performance Pro internet service. When I just talked to a technition I was told that Performance gets 25 mbs. Can anyone tell me what speed I should be getting with Performance Pro? Customers subscribing to eligible Triple Play bundles will receive the new, 3x faster Performance Pro speeds, and all new and existing customers with Blast! speed tiers will have their speeds go from 105 Mbps to 150 Mbps, an almost 50 percent increase. You tell the router how fast your line is, and how to value each type of traffic. For example from highest priority to lowest priority, I typically set my QoS order to be something like VOIP traffic +2, skype +1, anything that doesn't fit otherwise, downloading via http -1, steam downloads -2, and usenet -3. For those of you who are currently subscribed to Comcast’s Performance Xfinity Internet speed plans, you’re in for a treat. Comcast has decided to upgrade your data speeds at no added cost.

As for hulling strawberries, it means to remove the leaves and the core of the strawberry. # Ultimately it took 7 hours in the oven, and I probably could’ve left it just a smidge longer because there were some undried spots. Rachel — July 12th, 2014 @ 8:09 am . If the mixture is too thick or the oven temperature is not accurate, that can play a huge role in how long it will take to dry out completely.

Ionic compounds are easily recognized because they contain a metal and a nonmetal. Covalent compounds are those which contain only nonmetals. The periodic table in the front cover of your text shows which elements fall into each class. The names for ionic compounds are very simple. The first part of the name is simply the name of the metal element. The second part of the name is the name of the nonmetal element, with the ending changed to the suffix –ide. For example, consider the compound Al 2 O 3. While the subscripts indicate that the compound consists of two atoms of aluminum and three atoms of oxygen, these numbers do not affect the name. The first part of the name would be aluminum. For the second part of the name, we drop the ending on oxygen and add –ide, thus it becomes oxide. The name of the compound is then aluminum oxide. When an ionic compound contains a transition metal, the names become a bit more complicated. The metals in the d and f blocks can have more than one charge and can thus form more than one compound. For example, iron and chlorine form two different compounds, FeCl 2 and FeCl 3. To distinguish them, What do ya do if the metallic element in a binary ionic compound has more than one ionic charge? if the metallic element in a binary ionic compound has more than one common ionic charge, a Roman numeral must be included in the cation name.

Here’s the link to where I will be purchasing my second bottle of Apetamin. THIS is what your bottle should look like. The product will not be filled to the top. So you’re probably asking, what is Apetamin? It’s a vitamin syrup that works to enhance your appetite. For me in particular this was key because I have a very weak appetite. I’m talking I could literally eat once a day, with one little bottle of something to drink to help wash it down. Totally unhealthy, and not helpful to gaining weight. In fact, this habit is what helped me lose weight. Taking just 10ml of the apetamin syrup 3x before meals enabled me to eat an entire plate and still have room for more. The weight gain wasted no time following the new habit. My weight prior to starting the apetamin was 128.5lbs, 5 days into taking it I weighed 134.3lbs. That’s 6lbs in 5 days!!! Unbelievable, I know. One (1) bottle of Apetamin lasts approximately one week. The sleepiness or drowsiness usually occurs the first few days of taking Apetamin and will decrease thereafter. The Manufacturer's recommended adult dosage of Apetamin syrup is 10-15mL three times a day, take 10 to 30 minutes before meals. Does Apetamin make you sleepy? Yes, Apetamin can cause sleepiness or drowsiness for the first few days. If you stop using it and start up again you will most likely be sleepy again the first few days. Besides that if you use it regularly it will not effect your sleep schedule. How long does one (1) bottle last? One (1) bottle of Apetamin lasts approximately 7-10 Days, we suggest ordering your next bottle when your current bottle is at it’s half way point. Do I need to refrigerate Apetamin? It is recommended that Apetamin be stored at a temperature to be protected from sunlight & UV rays. A cool dark cabinet or draw is fine but it can stay in room temperature after opening for up to 2 weeks (if your taking your Apetamin correctly it should only last for a week [7-10 days]) Will I lose weight if I ...

Originally Answered: How long does it take to become a black belt in karate? There are a number of ways to answer this but the most correct answer is probably: it doesn't matter. The martial arts are more about the journey than the signposts you achieve along the way. It takes an average of 4-5 years to gain a black belt in karate. Some times longer depending on your age, your natural abilities, body type, coordination levels, fitness levels, the type of sports you have done before, how much you train, how much you listen to your instructor and so on. I remember my black belt grading was the toughest thing I had to go through and prepare for. I had to perform all 11 patterns and black belt pattern. I had to do the basic sets for all belt colours. All of the one step sparring. I had to demonstrate all kicks, and did 10 rounds of 2 minute pad sparring. The Kyokushin Black-belt grading is one of the toughest challenges a karateka can face and takes between five and six hours. It starts off with basics, then focuses on combination work, hand and leg techniques, kata, self-defence (kyojitsu) techniques, stamina and then the gruelling task of completing 40 one-and-a-half-minute rounds of full-contact fighting. How long does it take to get a black belt – in various martial arts? According to a longitudinal study (conducted from 1998 to 2014), the average time taken to get a first-degree black belt is ten years. Of course, this duration differs among martial arts. The shortest recorded training time is four years, while the longest to get a first-degree black belt is twenty-seven years. In Kyokushin it takes an average of five solid years to attain Black-belt level, for someone who does two-hour training sessions three-to-four times a week — but they must also take part in other activities such as seminars and tournaments, for example. Then again, to qualify for a black belt with him, you also have to qualify as a certified instructor of karate. 2 years is way too soon to earn a shodan rank. 4 or 5 years is fast, and average is something like 8-10 years to reach the skill level of shodan. Less isn't more when it comes to time training. Maybe I am asking to much and maybe 5 years to become a black belt is too much FOR THE AVERAGE student, but what I am very true is that 3 years is too little time. Again there could be a very nice student or a gifthed one that with alot of hard work and dedication could be a BB in 3 years and maybe a little less.

If solar power was used to charge the Powerwall, it would save the charging fee of $0.45 a day, making the Powerwall savings each year $358. Factoring in the installed solar panel cost of $3,570[2] for a 1.5 kilowatt system[iii], makes the payback period 31 years, still 3 times the warranty period. If you’re reviewing multiple quotes, there are plenty of metrics that can help you make a decision about which solar option is best for you, but studies show most solar shoppers rely on one metric in particular: the solar panel payback period. Here’s how the numbers pencil out for a North Carolina solar purchase with a small rooftop solar system: 1  First-year loan payments: $948. - 2  First-year electric bill savings: $275. = 3  First-year cost of solar: $673. 4  First year federal tax credit: $2,340. 5  Total in your pocket after year 1: $1,667. For most homeowners in Bee Cave who pay cash instead of financing, the average solar panel installation will pay for itself in 11 years.

How long does pregnancy last? Pregnancy (or the gestation period) lasts for 58 to 63 days in queens. Individual cats may vary but you should inform your veterinarian if your queen's pregnancy exceeds 64 days. What should you feed her during pregnancy? During pregnancy your queen should be on a well balanced diet. How to Tell if a Cat is Pregnant. The typical gestation period for cats is about 9 weeks, and a pregnant cat will begin to display telling physical and behavioral changes soon after becoming pregnant.http://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/docume... The Reproductive Cycle in Dogs. In order to answer the question, how long are dogs pregnant, you first need to understand the dog reproductive cycle. Intact female dogs go into heat approximately every six months, although this can vary depending on the dog and the breed. The heat cycle lasts 18-to-21 days and is broken into four distinct stages. So you were a little slow in having her spayed and your cat turned up pregnant, or a pregnant stray adopted you. Perhaps you are working with a rescue group and this is your first fostering experience with a pregnant cat. Where do you go from here? Your first major decision is whether or not to allow the pregnancy to continue. Gestation Period. A female cat that is sexually mature (after the age of 6 to 12 months) and has heat cycles can get pregnant is she meets a male cat. The gestation period is 9 weeks or 63 days. However, this is only an average; the cat may give birth earlier (as early as 58 days after the fertilization) or later (67 days after the fertilization). Ordinary domestic short-hair and long-haired cats are very fertile. Litter size averages four or five kittens. For some reason, Siamese cats also have larger litters. Persians and other fancy breeds tend to be less fertile. One thing you can be relieved about is that you won’t have to deal with the annoyances of a female cat in heat during that time. A cat will not go into heat again until after the babies are born. Caring for Your Cat During Gestation. It’s important to make your pregnant cat as comfortable as possible during gestation. On average, feline pregnancy lasts for 63-65 days but can be anywhere from 58 days to 70 days long. In 'real money', that's around nine weeks.

The Long March was an epic retreat by the three Red Armies of China that took place in 1934 and 1935, during the Chinese Civil War. It was a key moment in the civil war, and also in the development of communism in China. Long March: Long March, (1934–35), the 6,000-mile (10,000-km) historic trek of the Chinese communists, which resulted in the relocation of the communist revolutionary base from southeastern to northwestern China and in the emergence of Mao Zedong as the undisputed party leader. Fighting Nationalist forces The Long March (October 1934 – October 1936) was a military retreat undertaken by the Red Army of the Communist Party of China, the forerunner of the People's Liberation Army, to evade the pursuit of the Kuomintang (KMT or Chinese Nationalist Party) army. The Long March. The traumatic but ultimately victorious march of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communists ended on October 22nd, 1935. One of history’s great journeys began in October 1934 and ended a year later after covering a distance variously estimated at between 3,000 and 8,000 miles across China. Figures for the numbers involved vary hugely, but fewer than one in ten of those who started the trek apparently reached the end of it. The Long March made the survival of the imperilled Chinese Communist Party possible, gave Mao Zedong a secure grasp on its leadership and ultimately led to the creation of the People’s Republic of China.

This march began with Jiang Jieshi’s fifth and most successful Encirclement Campaign, which was launched against Jiangxi in the autumn of 1933. The Long March 1 was quickly replaced by the Long March 2 family of launchers.

Full Answer > An atom becomes an ion when it loses or gains an electron. An atom is electrically neutral. The protons and electrons are equal and balance each other. An ion is either positive or negative, depending on whether it gains or loses an electron. A calcium atom becomes a calcium ion by losing two electrons. Electrons are negatively charged, so losing two electrons creates an ion with a charge of 2+. According to the octet rule, atoms gain or lose electrons to fill their outer energy levels. This helps them achieve noble gas configuration. Calcium is atomic number 20 on the periodic table. Its nearest noble gas is argon, which has an atomic number of 18. To achieve argon's electron configuration, calcium needs to lose two electrons. When it does this, it becomes a positively charged ion. Although calcium is in the same period as the noble gas krypton, the calcium never attempts to attain krypton's electron configuration. This is because it takes less energy to lose two electrons than it would to gain six electrons and fill the outer energy level. Normally, an atom has the same number of positive particles (protons) and negative particles (electrons). 1  So the number of protons is identical to the number of electrons, and both are identical to the atomic number. 2  An ion with more electrons than protons carries a net negative charge and is called an anion.

What’s the deal? Here’s the short answer: no, you don’t have to refrigerate. Natural peanut butter keeps just fine in a cool, dark place like the pantry for at least a month ― which is more than enough time for many peanut butter lovers to consume it. But if you don’t eat this nutty spread that quickly, the fridge will keep it fresher longer. If you do refrigerate your natural peanut butter, be sure to stir it before doing so ― once it’s cold, it can be hard to stir the oil back into the peanut butter. But once that’s done, a jar will easily keep in the fridge for six months. Do not purchase bulging cans, says USDA. But what about our favorite foods—peanut butter, peanuts and peanut products? Peanut butter’s shelf life may depend on the way you store it. Follow the guide above and remember to store peanuts in airtight containers. An open jar of peanut butter stays fresh up to three months in the pantry. After that, it’s recommended to store the peanut butter in the fridge (where it can maintain its quality for another 3-4 months). If you don’t refrigerate, oil separation can occur. Here’s a run-down. Refrigerated peanut butter won’t spread that easily, but it prevents oil separation and helps retain the flavor. Image used under Creative Commons from Bobbi Bowers If you’re making peanut butter yourself and you’re not using any stabilizers or hydrogenated fat, your peanut butter should last a few months, possibly half a year. Because you’re not using any stabilizers, it’s quite natural that oil will separate – that’s not harmful to the sandwich spread, you can just stir contents of the jar and you’re ready to use it. Peanut Butter, unopened 6-9 months Refrigeration not needed. Peanut Butter, opened 2-3 months Lasts 6 -9 months in refrigerator. Peanuts: Bagged, in the shell or out 1-2 months Lasts 4-6 months in refrigerator. Peanuts: in cans or jars, unopened 2 years. Peanut Flour, unopened 1 year. The all natural peanut butter does not have sugar or hydrogenated oil in it. Therefore the fat will come to the top and you have to stir it. If you refrigerate it, it will stay mixed longer and you don’t have to stir it. I’ve been doing this for about 50 years now.

If your first test is done in a testing lab and it’s positive, the lab will conduct the follow-up testing, usually on the same blood sample as the first test. Talk to your health care provider to see what type of HIV test is right for you. If you test negative on an HIV RNA test after two weeks of possibly being exposed, you are very likely HIV-negative. If you test negative on a 4th generation rapid test or lab assay that detects HIV antigens (part of the HIV virus) in addition to antibodies after three or four weeks after possibly being infected, you are very likely HIV-negative. And if you test negative on an antibody test taken 3 months or longer after your last possible risk of possible exposure to HIV, you are likely HIV-negative. The person who gives you your HIV test will have additional information about the test's window period.. For this reason, we recommend that people who are having sex get tested routinely every 3 months.

It's a bit like a floppy balloon – as your bladder fills, it expands to store the urine. On average, your bladder can hold 400 to 600ml of urine for up to about five hours. The muscle in your bladder wall is called the detrusor muscle. The detrusor muscle relaxes to allow your bladder to fill. When you go to the toilet, it contracts to squeeze out urine.

It’s considered very negative and can cause your credit scores to drop significantly. Even worse, under federal law, unpaid tax liens can remain on credit reports indefinitely, though in practice credit bureaus may remove them after a decade or so. (Once paid and released, a tax lien must be removed seven years from the date it was filed.) There is a way to make tax liens disappear from your credit reports completely, and quickly, though. Unfortunately, not all taxpayers who are dealing with this problem know about it. You can qualify to request your lien be withdrawn, if: 1  Your tax liability has been satisfied (you’ve paid what you owe) and your lien has been released; 2  You are in compliance for the past three years in filing your individual and business returns, and information returns (as applicable) and; If you have more than one tax lien on your report that is eligible for removal, you will need a Form 12277 for each lien you want withdrawn.

A tax lien—the government's claim against all or some of your assets based on your failure to pay a tax debt on time—is one of the worst things that can appear on your credit report. It's a public record viewed by the credit bureaus, equal to a judgment or bankruptcy. Not long ago, I reviewed the credit report of a friend who had two tax liens on his credit reports. Though he had paid them off a couple years prior, he had no idea he could request they be removed from his reports. Thanks for your patience. 1  I went through the process and have a signed 10916 form (the lien was paid over 6 years ago). I have sent it to all 3 of the credit reporting agencies and Transunion responded as ‘release of tax lien verified, no change’. 2  http://www.Credit.com/. Within 30 days you should receive updated credit reports from each of the three credit bureaus. 5. Check each report to ensure that the tax lien(s) were expunged. If any of the three bureaus did not remove the lien(s), you will need to contact the bureau and be tenacious until it is removed. Step 4: Dispute the lien with the Credit Reporting Agencies. When you dispute a tax lien with Equifax, Experian or TransUnion, they contact the courthouse where the lien was filed to determine if the information is still accurate. The rest of my credit is good and my bills, credit cards, auto loans are all paid on time each and every time every month, but with these 3 federal tax liens on my credit reports I can not get my credit score above 600 and any time I need or want any financing the bank wants 40-50% down before they will approve it.

It’s important to not confuse “activity” with “exercise.” Not everything you do that’s activity is the same thing. Adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. 1  Exercise recommendations can be met through 30-60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (five days per week) or 20-60 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise (three days per week). Use each of the methods periodically to add variety to your workouts. 1  Continuous training is the most common method of aerobic exercise. It involves sustaining one exercise intensity for several minutes 20-60 minutes (or more for long-distance training) at a time. Performing the recommended 150 minutes per week of cardio exercises, 30-60 minutes of low to moderate intensity exercise per day for 5 days or 20-30 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise 3 times per week is enough to reap the benefits and provide you with noticeable results. Check with your doctor before starting an exercise program. 1  Get more about exercise safety tips for beginners. 2  Choose an activity you enjoy. You are more likely to stick with it. 3  Always warm up for at least 5-10 minutes before starting your activity. 4  Start slowly and listen to your body. Go at a pace that feels good to you. Each week you can increase speed or duration, but do not increase it by more than 5-10% each week. As your fitness level increases gradually, increase the number of sessions per week and the intensity or length of the sessions until you are performing 3-5 sessions of 60 minutes a week at a moderate to high intensity. Continuous training is the most common method of aerobic exercise. 1  It involves sustaining one exercise intensity for several minutes 20-60 minutes (or more for long-distance training) at a time. 2  Interval training involves alternating between higher and lower intensity intervals throughout one workout. Frequency: Number of aerobic exercise sessions per week. Aim for a minimum of 3 days per week with no more than 2 days off between sessions. Gradually work your way up to 5 or 6 days per week. Frequency is especially important when it comes to weight loss since more cardio sessions will help you burn more calories. Give yourself at least 1 to 2 days off from aerobic exercise each week. Intensity: How hard you should exercise during each session Aerobic exercise should take place at a “moderate” intensity level (not too easy, not too hard). Here are some additional benefits of aerobic exercise: 1  Reduce belly fat. 2  Promotes brain growth. 3  Prevents stress. 4  Promotes focus. 5  Interrupts anxiety. 6  Regulates depression.

Share: Chemotherapy targets cancer cells through similar biological processes. For instance, early chemotherapy drugs attacked folate, which is a key component of cellular division. Since cancer cells divide more than normal cells, they are more greatly harmed by this drug. Newer chemotherapy agents target specific mutations in certain cancer cells, making their effects very specific to only the tumor. To your last point, radiation and chemo both can induce future cancers. Radiation therapy targets cancer cells in two ways. First, we shape the beam of radiation such that it conforms as closely as possible to the shape of the tumor. We also treat from multiple different angles, with all beams converging on the tumor. Best Answer: The short answer is that they don't differentiate between cell types. This is why there are side effects. There are a variety of different mechanisms that the chemo meds employ, down-regulating certain proteins from being made, binding certain receptors to trigger cell death, etc. You hit it when you said the chemo meds mostly target rapidly dividing cells (or highly metabolically active cells.) And we're able to be relatively tissue specific too, so different drugs have affinities for different tissues. (That's why chemo for lung cancer and chemo for prostate cancer, for example, are very different protocols.) And the more we learn about how cancer cells work in the body, the more we're able to develop new tools to address them.

Their work was done in mouse models of breast cancer, and findings held up in a human breast cancer cell line. The studies also provided more evidence -- at least in their animal models -- of why the stem cells are an important target. Normally, stem cells make progenitor cells, which make specific cells that comprise the breast. In this sense, the tumor is targeted geometrically - the radiation is aimed at the tumor, and not normal tissue. Secondly, cancer cells are more sensitive to radiation damage. Since they move through the cell cycle so rapidly, they are more likely to be in a specific, radiosensitive phase of cellular activity.

Gel electrophoresis can also be used for separation of nanoparticles. Gel electrophoresis uses a gel as an anticonvective medium and/or sieving medium during electrophoresis, the movement of a charged particle in an electrical field. What are the components of a gel electrophoresis chamber? What kinds of macromolecules can you look at with gel electrophoresis? Do you need to use different techniques for the different kinds of macromolecules? How do you visualize the macromolecules in the gel? What are real-life examples of what gel electrophoresis is used for? Bibliography Once these are separated, a photo is taken of the gel, providing a picture of the separated molecular parts. This process is called electrophoresis and helps us to better understand and identify the molecular components of living things. Forensics In the world of forensics, gel electrophoresis is used to obtain a DNA fingerprint of a criminal. This means that scientists can accurately tell whether two pieces of DNA, one found at a crime scene and one belonging to a suspect, are matches. Gel electrophoresis is a method for separation and analysis of macromolecules and their fragments, based on their size and charge. It is used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge and/or size and in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments or to separate proteins by charge. Nucleic acid molecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the negatively charged molec · Gel Electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE Gel Electrophoresis which includes Protein Gel Electrophoresis Current Uses of Gel Electrophoresis -Gel electrophoresis is a technique used for the separation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), or protein molecules by using an electric field and a gel matrix. DNA Gel electrophoresis is usually used in order for investigations. DNA profiling is the process of determining an individual's DNA characteristics, called a DNA profile, that is very likely to be different in unrelated individuals, thereby being as unique to individuals as are fingerprints. DNA profiling with the aim of identifying not an individual but a species is called DNA barcoding. DNA profiling is most commonly used as a forensic technique in criminal investigations to identify an unidentified person or whose identity needs to be confirmed, or to place a person at a crime scene or to eliminate a person from consideration. Electrophoresis is used in DNA for fingerprints for forensics, paternity testing, checking PCR reactions, disease detection and to look for evolutionary relationships among organisms. A solution of negatively charged DNA molecules are pulled through gel using an electric field. Thanks to TV shows like CSI, many people are familiar with the use of gel to separate macromolecules like DNA. However, gel electrophoresis91112 can also be used to separate out proteins. Different proteins have different sizes, mainly due to the number of building blocks in their structure. Gel Electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments by their sizes and charges. It makes it possible to identify the differences and similarities between different plants and animals. Although there are some different types of Gel Electrophoresis such as Capillary and Agarose, this is how the general technology works: Quick Answer.

A woman takes about 47... Full Answer > Your body uses mechanical and chemical means to digest food and it varies depending on the individual according to Michael Picco, M.D With Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist. The digestion process takes between 24 and 72 hours, six to eight hours to pass through your stomach and small intestine. Then the food enters your large intestine (colon) for further digestion and absorption of water. Elimination of undigested food residue usually begins after 24 hours. Think of a highway, if the slowest cars are in front they'll hold up the faster cars behind them, causing a traffic jam. The same goes for your food. Eat those fastest to digest first and save the tougher to digest foods for the second half of your meal. Here are the time sequences for different food groups: Water & Juices: 20-30 minutes.

There will be no effects on baby whatsoever from the loss of fluid. Amniotic ... Answers. 1  The amniotic fluid, or bag of waters, surrounds and protects the baby in the uterus and provides a protective barrier from the outside environment. Once the bag of waters breaks, bacteria now has a way of entering the uterus through the vagina and could cause an infection in either the baby, the mother or both.

Some Mumsnetters like to stick to a rigid timetable. For example: “I wake my son up at about 7am, then make sure he is awake and active for two hours before allowing him a nap in his room of no longer than 40 minutes. Unless you think that your baby is hungry or ill, see what happens if you leave your baby alone for a few minutes — he or she might settle down. If your baby wakes during the period that you want him or her to sleep, keep activity to a minimum. By three months, most babies can sleep for about six hours a night and are more alert during the day. If your baby isn't napping regularly, you should start working on a sleep schedule. Sleep experts and parents agree that the key to successful napping is to be consistent: Baby naps at the same time, in the same place, with the same routine each day. First, wait until your baby is physically and emotionally ready to sleep through the night, usually between 4 and 6 months of age. Ferber doesn't designate a precise age at which to begin his technique, since it can vary so much depending on the child. Your newborn baby might be sleeping through the night at 8 weeks. Or it may be 8 months. You may get a lucky night where she sleeps all night and then be horrified when it never happens again. I know how tired you are. By 6 months, your baby will probably be taking two or three naps a day: one in the morning, one in the early afternoon, and another later in the afternoon. At 9 to 12 months, most babies are down to two naps a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. If your baby naps at a nursery or child minder's then speak to them, find out what time your baby’s naps take place there, and try to follow the same routine on the days when your baby is at home with you. the child is getting 11 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night. the child takes longer to fall asleep for the morning nap. the child takes an increasingly shorter morning nap or too long of a morning nap and refuses an afternoon nap. In the end, you feel stuck in the “one nap is not enough and two is too many” phase When you are ready to begin the transition, push your child’s morning nap a little later. Babies like structure—it's the underlying principle for many popular parenting books, from Becoming Baby Wise to Secrets of the Baby Whisperer. And many moms agree. I can't change naptime, ever, says Allison, mom to baby Silas, from Virginia. I have to be consistent about what time my son naps..

Though it varies from person to person, on an average, 3 minutes is the maximum time where the person can stay alive without oxygen. Yoga and meditation experts may hold breath for longer than this, but these are very rare examples. In an absence of oxygen, brain cells begin to die and this effect is irreversible! The brain cannot go without oxygen for more than ten minutes. If oxygen is not able to get to the brain before this, then there is a possibility of irreversible brain damage. The brain cannot go without oxygen for more than ten minutes. If oxygen is not able to get to the brain before this, then there is a possibility of irreversible brain damage. How long can someone go without oxygen before there is brain damage ? If someone has been without oxygen for 15 minutes is there any hope that they can wake from a coma without any brain damage. If there is brain damage, is it always severe or does it depend on each patient ? Questions and Answers About Transplantation and Donation. Below are some frequently asked questions about brain death, how organ donation works, the need for donors, organ failure, and transplantation. 1. What do medical personnel do to save the life of a person with a head injury? 2. What kinds of injuries may lead to brain death? 3. How long can the brain go without oxygen before serious damage occurs? 4. What happens when your brain is injured? 5. What can be done if your brain is injured? 6. What is brain death? Doesn't the person's heart have to stop for them to be dead? 7. How can you tell if someone is brain dead? 8. What does a brain dead person look like? 9. If the person is brain dead how can the heart still be beating? 10. 3. How long can the brain go without oxygen before serious damage occurs? After five to ten minutes of not breathing, you are likely to develop serious and possibly irreversible brain damage. The one exception is when a younger person stops breathing and also becomes very cold at the same time. This can occur when a child is suddenly plunged into very cold water and drowns. In this situation, survival after more than 30 minutes has been known to occur. Return to the list of Frequently Asked Questions >> So expect a minute at most before permanent brain damage, and maybe 3 minutes at max before total death. And if you want to experience having overly oxygen-rich blood, take a few deep, meditative breaths. Humans are aerobic creatures, meaning we require oxygen to release energy and exist. Without oxygen, our cells wouldn’t be able to release the energy in the food we eat, and we would die. We take in oxygen through respiration — we move air in and out of the lungs, and blood takes oxygen to the cells of the body. Carbon dioxide, a waste product in our bodies, is moved out of the body by the same system. Breathing has always been synonymous with life. Our speech is permeated with idioms and phrases relying on the idea that taking a breath is the surest sign of vitality, and we constantly compare things we need to our body’s ultimate necessity: oxygen. Under relatively normal circumstances, we start struggling after a few minutes without oxygen. Without being able to convert energy and use it up, cells start to die. This happens throughout the entire body, but it is the brain’s lack of oxygen that is most urgent. “The brain is a highly metabolically active organ,” Tishler said. “It needs oxygen to generate the energy to function. Without the energy (without oxygen) it dies.” The brain normally takes up about 20 percent of the body’s oxygen. If it doesn’t get what it needs, cells begin dying off, putting a person at risk of permanent brain damage. If a person suffocates, or suffers another type of involuntary oxygen deprivation, they’ll ultimately suffer brain death: the utter, irreversible loss of brain function. It’s a pretty unavoidable succession of events. Between 30-180 seconds of oxygen deprivation, you may lose consciousness. At the one-minute mark, brain cells begin dying. At three minutes, neurons suffer more extensive damage, and lasting brain damage becomes more likely. At five minutes, death becomes imminent. At 10 minutes, even if the brain remains alive, a coma and lasting brain damage are almost inevitable. At 15 minutes, survival becomes nearly impossible. There are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Some training routines help the body make more efficient use of oxygen, enabling the brain to go longer periods without this vital element. Free divers routinely train to go long periods without oxygen, and the current record holder held his breath for 22 minutes without sustaining brain damage!

Shanidar Cave, which dates to sixty to eighty thousand years ago, is a Neanderthal site in modern-day Iraq. The excavations of this site are important when considering the question of whether Neanderthals buried their dead12. Skhul Cave, in Israel, is a site that was inhabited by AMH during the Middle Pleistocene6. The result is that mtDNA is passed on only along the maternal line. This means that all of the mtDNA in the cells of a person's body are copies of his or her mother's mtDNA, and all of the mother's mtDNA is a copy of her mother's, and so on. No matter how far back you go, mtDNA is always inherited only from the mother. If you went back six generations in your own family tree, you'd see that your nuclear DNA is inherited from 32 men and 32 women. Your mtDNA, on the other hand, would have come from only one of those 32 women. Moreover, the researchers determined that the common ancestor to Neanderthals and modern Homo sapiens lived as long as 500,000 years ago, well before the most recent common mtDNA ancestor of modern humans. This suggests (though it does not prove) that Neanderthals went extinct without contributing to the gene pool of any modern humans. Final note The Neanderthal genes that turn up in people today are from this older era, after the two species were in contact but well before Neanderthal extinction. The intermingling seen in the new study took place after that early interbreeding era, Higham says. Although we know far more about Neanderthals than we did when they were first discovered (or even fifty years ago),just as many questions remain. As the body of research on the subject of Neanderthals grows, however, the picture will only get clearer. Shanidar Cave, which dates to sixty to eighty thousand years ago, is a Neanderthal site in modern-day Iraq. The excavations of this site are important when considering the question of whether Neanderthals buried their dead 12. New fossil dates show our ancient cousins disappeared 40,000 years ago. View Images A Neanderthal jawbone from Spain was among those dated for a new study that pushes back the date for the Neanderthals' demise. Photograph by Thomas Higham, University of Oxford PUBLISHED August 20, 2014 This, in fact, has been done, with mtDNA from the bones of Neanderthals. Comparing mtDNA of these Neanderthals to mtDNA of living people from various continents, researchers have found that the Neanderthals' mtDNA is not more closely related to that of people from any one continent over another. Here is a series of short summaries of some of the more important Neanderthal sites, some of which have already been discussed in this section. 1  Atapuerca is a large site in Spain with several different areas.

Some may find the cracking of balls and merriment disturbing in a shared open-plan space. Others see it as setting the tone for fun and relaxation, especially in a vacation home. What You Need To Move A Pool Table By Yourself Moving a pool table across country by yourself is rarely a viable option simply because long distances are, in most cases, not suited to self-moving. However, if you plan to move your pool table across town or locally to another close-by city within the same state, then you will definitely be interested in knowing how to move a pool table by yourself. There are two basic grades of cloth for a pool table. The pool table ‘felt’ is not felt at all, but rather a woven fabric. Some cloths are available with a wool / nylon blend, with speed cloths normally developed in this way. These cloths would tyopically comprise of about 80% wool and 20% nylon content. A pool table is one of the hardest things you can move. It’s heavy, bulky, wide, and surprisingly delicate. The DIY approach can be dangerous to you and to the pool table. A lot of people make the mistake of trying to treat it like a dresser or sofa by calling a bunch of friends to help, and then twisting it every which way to fit through the door. If you ask an owner of a one piece slate furniture style pool table, they will likely give you a different reason. When they purchased the table (around 35 years ago), they were told that a one piece slate was far superior. A one piece slate has no seams to affect the playing field. Step 1, Acquire four wooden dollies. These wooden wheeled wonders make moving heavy objects a cinch. You'll want to wrap the edges of your dollies in carpet or fabric. This will prevent the legs of the pool table from being scratched.[1][2]Step 2, Position your equipment. Distribute your dollies around each corner of your pool table to prepare each for being slid under its legs. Clear the area around the pool table so that there are no objects that might get caught in the wheels ... Q. Do your pool tables have warranties? A. Most our tables have LIFETIME Warranties! Q. What kind of maintenance does a pool table require? A. Very little. Keep it clean and covered when not in use. It is comparable to a piece of fine furniture. Q. Are there different grades of cloth? A. Yes. We currently offer three different grades of cloth. The profile of the rail cushion, which is the cushion's angle in relation to the bed of the table, varies between table types.

Extreme dryness is believed to cause this eczema and the rate of asteatotic eczema is high during winter season. Symptoms : The skin becomes totally dry forming several cracks on the upper surface. The skin becomes totally dry due to loss of natural oil and shows cracks. First described by Brocq in 1907, using the term eczema craquelé, asteatotic dermatitis is characterized by pruritic, dry, cracked, and polygonally fissured skin with irregular scaling. It most commonly occurs on the shins of elderly patients, but it may occur on the hands and the trunk. Asteatotic eczema is a term often applied to describe patients who have thin, dried, cracked-appearing skin, usually especially bad on the lower legs. Significant involvement of the palms and soles of the feet is not usual and may suggest a different condition such as fungal infection, scabies infestation, or allergic contact dermatitis.

How long after being exposed to the flu will symptoms start to appear? Dr. Ralph Morgan Lewis Dr. Lewis See below: Incubation period for influenza a & b averages 2 days (range 1-4 days). Avian flu (h5n1) incubation depends upon whether exposed to infected bird (less than 7 days) or to infected human (generally 3-5 days). People often confuse cold symptoms with those of the flu. However, cold symptoms are usually milder and don't last as long as flu symptoms. You can spread the flu to others before your symptoms start and for another 3 to 4 days after your symptoms appear.

For best results, keep cheese frozen for no more than 6 months. When freezing cheese, cut it into portions no larger than 1/2 pound each, and wrap tightly in airtight wrapping or place inside a heavy-duty freezer bag. You can also grate cheese before freezing and place it in a freezer bag. Be sure to thaw the frozen cheese in your refrigerator, and plan to use it within two or three days. Refrigerated Food and Power Outages: When to Save and When to Throw Out. Adapted from Keeping Food Safe During an Emergency (USDA). Is food in the refrigerator safe during a power outage? It should be safe as long as power is out no more than 4 hours. Keep the door closed as much as possible. Discard any perishable food (such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and leftovers) that have been above 40 °F for over 2 hours. Never taste food to determine its safety! You can’t rely on appearance or odor to determine whether food is safe. If it’s been opened, limit it to one week in the fridge, or one month in the freezer as long as it’s tightly covered. How do I know if yogurt has gone bad? The best way is to use your nose and your eyes. Others who ate the same yogurt but didn't see the expiration date enjoyed the food without claims of spoilage. Ultimately, it all depends on the type of food. Read on to find out specifics. Yes - to further extend the shelf life of yogurt, freeze it in a covered airtight container or heavy-duty freezer bag. How long does yogurt last in the freezer? Properly stored, it will maintain best quality for 1 to 2 months, but will remain safe beyond that time. The freezer time shown is for best quality only - yogurt that has been kept constantly frozen at 0° F will keep safe indefinitely. How long does yogurt last after being frozen and thawed? Yogurt that has been defrosted in the fridge can be kept for an additional 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator before using; yogurt that was thawed in the microwave or in cold water should be used immediately. Here's a guide to how long the following condiments will last once opened: ketchup, one month in pantry, six to eight months in fridge; mayonnaise, two months in fridge; jellies and jams, one year in fridge; mustard, six to eight months in fridge; peanut butter, two to three months in fridge; pickles, one to two months in fridge; sour cream, two weeks in fridge; salad dressing, three months in fridge; butter, three months in fridge (can be stored in the freezer for up to a year). In general, we don't recommend that you add yogurt directly to a boiling or extremely hot mixture. Instead, stir a few tablespoons of the hot food into the yogurt, warming it gradually. Then stir the warmed yogurt into your dish near the end of the cooking process, so the yogurt won't be heated for a long time. If the temperature is above 120° F, as it is in baking, it's unlikely that the live active cultures will survive. Can You Freeze Cheese Successfully?

The Japanese Navy had 25 carriers of all types; 1 was laid up damaged, another beached and capsized, 20 were lost to enemy action. The French Navy, as noted above, had 1 carrier, converted to an aircraft transport in 1944. This count is for commissioned naval vessels designated as aircraft carriers only.

The carrier reaches a maximum speed of over 30kt, and accommodates a complement of 3,184 personnel (with 203 officers); 2,800 aircrew (with 366 officers); and 70 flag (with 25 officers). Aircraft Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Wednesday defended his budget’s call to increase military spending by complaining that the U.S. has only 10 aircraft carriers and that the U.S. Army is smaller than it was in 1945 and the U.S. Navy is smaller than it was during World War I. List of aircraft carriers in service. This is a list of aircraft carriers which are currently in service, reserve, under construction, or being rebuilt. An aircraft carrier is a warship with a full-length flight deck, hangar and facilities for arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. The list only refers to the status of the ship, not availability or condition of an air wing. This includes helicopter carriers and amphibious assault ships, which are vessels whose primary purpose is to carry, arm, deploy, and recover aircraft. Statistically, one can take the numbers of carriers in action per month during the period and come up with a composite carrier’s profile of operating numbers: Flights: 2755; action sorties 1043; combat losses: 61; combat operational losses: 26; non-combat related losses: 28; for a total of 115 aircraft lost in a 12 month period. In the United States Navy, these consist of ships commissioned with hull classification symbols CV (aircraft carrier), CVA (attack aircraft carrier), CVB (large aircraft carrier), CVL (light aircraft carrier), CVN (aircraft carrier (nuclear propulsion)) and CVAN (attack aircraft carrier (nuclear propulsion)).

Enzymes in the lobster rot the meat very quickly. When buying frozen tails, look for ones that have been vacuum-sealed—they will last up to a year that way. Cooking Spiny Lobster. If you are lucky enough to find a whole lobster, you can use the meat in a variety of recipes—from lobster Thermidor and lobster salad to lobster sauce for pasta. Since the meat isn't as sweet and rich as a Maine lobster, recipes that have added flavors and ingredients work well. Four-ounce tails, then, should boil for four minutes, while 10-ounce tails will require 10 minutes. The Single-Tail Guideline. As always, the details are important. First, as with whole lobster, you'll need 2 to 3 quarts of boiling water per pound of tails. That way, your water will return to the boil quickly after the tails are added. Don't begin timing your tails until the water boils again, otherwise your timing will be off and the tails will be undercooked. Spiny lobster tails are traditionally grilled, basted with butter. They are also excellent steamed and roasted. Be sure to get the thin little strips of meat from the tail flippers! If you get the whole lobster, make lobster stock out of the body and legs -- once you've picked the body meat out. Grilling the Lobster Tails. 1 Once the grill is hot, at least 15 minutes, give the lobster tails one last baste, add a bit of salt and pepper and place them flesh side down on the hot grill. Be careful of flare-ups from the dripping butter. Cook flesh side down for 4 to 5 minutes until light grill marks show. Flip the lobster tails to shell side down. A similar and larger species, the California spiny lobster is a rare treat, gathered in traps or by hand by divers and sold live in tanks. This makes the U.S. spiny lobster fishery a best choice if you are eager to eat only sustainable seafood. The same can be said for lobsters taken in Baja, Mexico, and Australia.

Needless to say, we spend a lot more time in restaurants with claw machines and very little time eating lobster tails. However, updating this recipe because I no longer oil the grill prior to grilling anything. Once you've picked out the body meat, you can make lobster stock out of the body and legs. Spiny lobster tails are traditionally grilled and basted with butter. They are also excellent steamed and roasted. Eating Spiny Lobster. From an eating standpoint, most of the meat in a spiny lobster is in its tail. Thaw the Lobster Tails. 1 If the lobster tails are frozen, start by thawing them to room temperature by placing them in a plastic bag and then submerge them in a warm bowl of water. Prepare Basting Sauce. 1 Next create a basting sauce. Melt the butter in a small dish in the microwave, or warm in a small pan and remove from heat. These can be as small as 2 to 3 ounces or as large as a pound in weight, depending on the species and origin of the lobster itself. If you're working from a recipe and purchased the specified size of tails, you can simply follow the recipe's instructions. Otherwise, the usual rule of thumb for lobster tails is one minute of boiling time for every ounce. Four-ounce tails, then, should boil for four minutes, while 10-ounce tails will require 10 minutes.

Getting the Retro Receiver up and running is as easy as plugging a controller into the front of your Super Nintendo—but it might actually be easier since there’s no cord to first untangle.

The average pay for a neurosurgeon ranges between £53.00 and £56.75 per hour. This brings to an average of £113,500 per month, however though different regions across UK offer different salary amounts to the neurosurgeons.

In surgery, the training is rigorous and the lifestyle that accompanies a busy surgical practice is taxing, but surgery is also one of the most rewarding fields of medicine. After training, the average general surgeon works 50-60 hours per week (not including time available for call). Depending on the practice situation chosen, you can be on call as much as all the time (if in private solo practice) to once a week (if in a large group practice). The following specialists are some of the most common examples: 1  Allergists (specialists in diagnosing and treating hay fever or other allergies) 2  Cardiologists (heart specialists) 3  Dermatologists (skin specialists) 4  Gastroenterologists (digestive system specialists) 5  Ophthalmologists (eye specialists) Pediatricians who work full time don't necessarily work a standard 40-hour week, according to a December 2009 article in “Pediatrics,” which reported full-time pediatricians in subspecialties such as pediatric surgery worked an average of 33.7 hours a week.

It is also used topically to encourage the regrowth of hair in people who are balding. For example, a 2012 study titled “Clay jojoba oil facial mask for lesioned skin and mild acne” found that applying a clay mask and jojoba oil mix applied to the face daily for six weeks could noticeably improve the skin tone and reduce acne. jojoba is brilliant, the oil that most closely resembles our skin's sebum, so perfect for any type!!! is also a brilliant eye make up remover too! and coconut oil is fab as a cleanser and also for making flapjacks!!!!

Add 2 ounces of jojoba oil to a small bottle, then add 10 drops of rosemary essential oil and 15 drops of tea tree essential oil. Put a lid on the bottle and shake it gently. Smooth a few drops of the oil mixture over your forehead, nose, cheeks and chin. Let the oil soak in for a minute, then moisten a cotton pad with witch hazel. Wipe your face with the pad. Step 4.

The use of street address meaning just the line with number and street name is (valid) jargon usage within a technical industry, but it's not so commonly understood that way by the general public. Address (geography) An address is a collection of information, presented in a mostly fixed format, used to give the location of a building, apartment, or other structure or a plot of land, generally using political boundaries and street names as references, along with other identifiers such as house or apartment numbers. Some addresses also contain special codes, such as a postal code, to make identification easier and aid in the routing of mail. In these cases, the street name will usually follow the house name. Such an address might read: Smith Cottage, Frog Lane, Barchester, Barsetshire, BZ9 9BA or Dunroamin, Emo, Co. Laois, Ireland (fictional examples).

IPV is given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on the patient's age. Polio vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Most people should get polio vaccine when they are children. Children get 4 doses of IPV at these ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and a booster dose at 4-6 years. OPV has not been used in the United States since 2000 but is still used in many parts of the world. 1  What Everyone Should Know Basic information for people interested in the vaccine... (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/public/index.html) These antibodies protect you from illness should you become infected with the polio virus. The vaccine is safe to be given if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Before 2004, the polio vaccine was given as drops into the mouth. It is now always given as an injection. If you have previously started a course of polio immunisation with oral vaccine you can finish off the course with polio injections. You do not need to start again. Polio immunisation timetable The polio vaccine is used to help prevent these diseases in children and adults. This vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. Polio mainly affects children under 5 years of age. Polio is very infectious. The infection usually spreads from person to person through contact with the stools (faeces) of an infected person. MMR is a two-shot series of vaccines usually given during childhood. A child should receive the first shot when he is between 12-15 months, and the second when he's between 4-6 years of age. If you're not sure if you have had the diseases or the vaccines (prior to 1971 it was given in three separate shots), you can get the MMR vaccine as an adult. Talk to your doctor about it if: You were born after 1956. (If you were born during or before 1956, you are presumed to be immune, because many children had the diseases then.) In 2000, the U.S. switched to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Using an inactive (dead) form of the virus that cannot cause polio, the IPV is given as a shot in the arm or leg. Who Needs the Polio Vaccine. Most people should get the polio vaccine when they are children. Children should be vaccinated with four doses of IPV at the following ages: Meningococcal vaccine is also recommended for children aged 2 months through 18 years who travel to or reside in areas where N. meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic; for these children, providers should take care to use a meningococcal vaccine that is licensed for the child’s age group and contains all 4 serotypes (A, C, Y, W-135). The first polio vaccine was the inactivated polio vaccine. It was developed by Jonas Salk and came into use in 1955. The oral polio vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961. It would only take one person infected with polio coming from another country to bring the disease back here if we were not protected by vaccination. If the effort to eliminate the disease from the world is successful, some day we won't need polio vaccine. Until then, we need to keep getting our children vaccinated. Polio vaccine Like any medicine, there’s a very small chance that the polio vaccine could cause a serious reaction. Keep in mind that getting the polio vaccine is much safer than getting polio.

Some people are born with nails that are curved and grow into the skin. Others have toenails that are too large for their toes. Stubbing your toe or other injuries can also lead to an ingrown toenail. There are several different things you can do to fix an ingrown toenail. The severity of your condition will dictate which one is best for you. If you catch the ingrown toenail early enough, you can redirect its growth away from the skin.

Healing Ingrown Toenail. I know that an injury towards the cuticle of the nail area takes about 9 months to grow all the way out on your big toe. As far as an ingrown nail, it has to be treated or partially removed before the healing starts. You will feel much better within a day or two, but still takes longer to heal correctly. Warm soaks in saltwater will help ease the pain and heal it faster. Tea Tree Oil is helpful too. It will act as a soothing antiseptic and keeps fungus under control. Antibiotic that you take by mouth or rub onto your skin to treat an ingrown hair infection There isn't any real treatment for ingrown hair other than to grow out your beard.

Link/Cite. Fossil - Types. 1  Index fossils (also known as guide fossils, indicator fossils or zone fossils) are fossils used to define and identify geologic periods (or faunal stages). They work on the premise that, although different sediments may look different depending on the conditions under which they were deposited, they may include the remains of the same species of fossil. The mold is the impression in the rock it left. This is like pouring chocolate into a mold. When the chocolate hardens, it pops out as a chocolate cast, ready to eat. Examples: Fossil shells are often casts, and shell impressions on rock are often molds. A fossilized footprint is a mold. Plant fossils and trilobites are often found as casts and molds. There are two main types of fossils: body and trace fossils. 1  Body fossils - Body fossils are fossils where some portion of the actual organism's body remains as part of the fossil.

VA Loan requirements after a short sale are only 2 years, offer 100% financing, no required mortgage insurance and a FICO score of 550 or better. Qualifying for an FHA Loan After Foreclosure FHA loans are the most forgiving of foreclosures. To qualify for an FHA mortgage loan, you must wait at least three years after the foreclosure. The three-year clock starts ticking from the time that the foreclosure case has ended, usually from the date that your prior home was sold in the foreclosure proceeding. That leaves about 4 million families who lost their homes to foreclosure who may still have it listed on their credit reports. That's a lot of people who potentially may want to buy a home within seven years of foreclosure. To be approved for a home loan within seven years of a foreclosure, here are some loan options and things to do: Improve your credit score FICO credit scores range from 300 to 850 and most mortgage lenders require at least a 620 to 660 score. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is not a mortgage lender; the FHA does not make loans. Rather, it insures loans for banks that do. The FHA publishes a compendium of rules known as FHA mortgage guidelines and so long as a mortgage meets of the rules' minimum standards, the FHA will insure the loan-issuing bank against default. A better name for an FHA mortgage, then, might be FHA-insured mortgage; it's a more accurate reflection of the relationship between the FHA and mortgage lender nationwide.

When you are ready to fill out an FHA loan application in the wake of a short sale, what do the FHA loan rules say about having such a transaction on your record? FHA loan rules for new loans following a short sale may seem complex--the rules that apply to you often depend on the status of your mortgage loan prior to the short sale. We have written about these rules in the past, but since the publication of the FHA Single Family Loan program handbook, HUD 4000.1, there have been many changes and updates to portions of FHA home loan policy. FHA has a list of short sale (also known as a “pre-foreclosure sale) rules and regulations in HUD 4000.1 for borrowers looking to become homeowners once more. At least two years must have elapsed since the discharge date of the borrower and / or spouse's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, according to FHA guidelines. This is not to be confused with the bankruptcy filing date. A full explanation will be required with the loan application.

For the entire 2014 season, the average length of games was just one minute more than the opening stretch at 3:02. The pace of the game has slowed dramatically over the years. In 1981, the average length of games was 2:33. There is nothing wrong with long games if there is enough baseball to fill the hours.

Galactose is classified as a monosaccharide, an aldose, a hexose, and is a reducing sugar. How is alpha glucose different from beta glucose? In alpha glucose the hydroxyl group at carbon one is below the plane of the ring. In beta glucose the hydroxyl group at carbon one is above the plane of the ring. What is the structure of alpha glucose? Glucose is also known as D-glucose, dextrose, or grape sugar is found in plants and it is a byproduct of photosynthesis and fuels for cellular respiration. Glucose is used as energy by living organisms. Galactose is a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet compared to glucose. It is a C-4 epimer of glucose. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration of only one stereogenic center. Diastereomers are a class of stereoisomers. What type of bond is formed between two sugars in a disaccharide?

Glucose is a hexose; galactose is a pentose The spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group on the fourth carbon is different. 100% (1 rating) Glucose is also called blood sugar, as it circulates in the blood, and relies on the enzymes glucokinase or hexokinase to initiate metabolism. Your body processes most carbohydrates you eat into glucose, either to be used immediately for energy or to be stored in muscle cells or the liver as glycogen for later use. Galactose (galacto-+ -ose, milk sugar), sometimes abbreviated Gal, is a monosaccharide sugar that is about as sweet as glucose, and about 30% as sweet as sucrose. It is a C-4 epimer of glucose. How does glucose differ from galactose? In glucose the hydroxyl group at carbon four is below the plane of the ring. In galactose the hydroxyl group at carbon four is above the plane of the ring. Galactose is nearly identical to glucose in structure except for one hydroxyl group on carbon atom number four of the six-sided sugar. Since it differs in only one position about all six asymmetric centers in the linear form of the sugar, galactose is known as an epimer of glucose. they both have their -OH on carbon 4 in different places. up on galactose and down on glucose how is sucrolose made from sucrose by replacing some of the hydroxyl grps iwth chlorine Glucose and galactose are diastereoisomers.

It's easy and works on all fluores... Linear fluorescent light bulbs are measured in two ways length and diameter. The length is measured from the end the pins. The most common sizes in length for T12's and T8's are 12, 15, 18, 24, 36 and 48 inches long. Howerver, T5 light bulbs are metric and standard sizes are not the same as T12 and T8. Some of their common sizes are around 22, 34 and 46 inches. The second measurement is the diameter of the light bulb. Fluorescent tube light bulbs are measured in 1/8 of inch increments. So a T12 light bulb is 12 x 1/8 of an inch, which equals 1 1/2 inches in diameter (T8 equals an inch and T5 equals 5/8 of an inch) length of the wire, and A x is its cross-sectional area. 1. Measure the length of the filament in the bulb: L = _____ m (The resistance of the other wires in the bulb is small enough to be ignored.

Iron deficiency is associated with reversible abnormalities of immune function, but it is difficult to demonstrate the severity and relevance of these in observational studies. Iron treatment has been associated with acute exacerbations of infection, in particular, malaria. Iron and the immune system. Ward RJ(1), Crichton RR, Taylor DL, Della Corte L, Srai SK, Dexter DT. Author information: (1)Biologie du Comportement, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 1348, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. roberta.ward@uclouvain.be In vitro studies of iron deficiency and functional immunity. Two component systems of active immunity—humoral and cell-mediated immunity—have been studied extensively, mainly in vitro, in relation to iron deficiency in both humans and animals. Iron is a mineral that plays an important role in immune function. A diet containing too little iron can contribute to anemia and weaken the immune system (1, 2, 3, 4). That's why it's important to optimize your intake of iron-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, legumes, nuts, seeds, cruciferous vegetables and dried fruit. In addition, lymphocytes play an important role in adaptive immunity. Thirdly, a variety of effector molecules, e.g. toll-like receptors, NF-κB, hypoxia factor-1, haem oxygenase, will orchestrate the inflammatory response by mobilising a variety of cytokines, neurotrophic factors, chemokines, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Iron and immunity are closely linked: firstly by the fact that many of the genes/proteins involved in iron homoeostasis play a vital role in controlling iron fluxes such that bacteria are prevented from utilising iron for growth; secondly, cells of the innate immune system, monocytes, macrophages, microglia and lymphocytes, are able to combat bacterial insults by carefully controlling their iron fluxes, which are mediated by hepcidin and ferroportin. To summarize in vitro evidence, iron deficiency depresses certain aspects of cell-mediated immunity, including lymphocyte, neutrophil and macrophage function; humoral immunity is unaffected and the significance of hypoferremia (as opposed to normal transferrin saturation) on growth of microorganisms is uncertain. Little evidence exists for systematic major humoral deficiencies in iron-deficient humans, and although specific defects in cell-mediated immunity have been well described and reviewed, even in latent iron deficiency, note that such minor functional changes cannot be compared with the devastating effects of the well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes (Dhur et al. 1989, Farthing 1989, Hershko 1993, Oppenheimer and Hendrickse 1983, Scrimshaw and San Giovanni 1997). Combining iron-rich foods with a source of vitamin C can help boost your absorption even further. That said, it's important to remember that overly high blood iron levels can be harmful and may actually suppress the immune system (5, 6, 7) Therefore, it's best to use iron supplements only if you have an iron deficiency, or on the advice of a doctor. Query: how does iron boost immunity","Firstly by the fact that many of the genes/proteins involved in iron homoeostasis play a vital role in controlling iron fluxes such that bacteria are prevented from utilising iron for growth; secondly, cells of the innate immune system, monocytes, macrophages, microglia and lymphocytes, are able to combat bacterial insults by carefully controlling their iron fluxes, which are mediated by hepcidin and ferroportin.",Iron is a mineral that plays an important role in immune function.,0.14241456985473633

The main function of the upper epidermis is water conservation. Although most of the cells of the lower epidermis resemble those of the upper epidermis, each stoma is flanked by two sausage-shaped cells called guard cells. These differ from the other cells of the lower epidermis not only in their shape but also in having chloroplasts. A cross section through the blade of a typical dicot leaf reveals 4 distinct tissue layers. 1  Upper epidermis.This is a single layer of cells containing few or no chloroplasts.

The rows of cells develop from the stem cells in the basal layer. ENaCs are found to be expressed in all layers of the epidermis. 1.The outermost layer of the leaf is the epidermis. It consists of the upper and lower epidermis, which are present on either side of the leaf. Botanists call the upper side the adaxial surface (or adaxis) and the lower side the abaxial surface (or abaxis). The epidermis aids in the regulation of gas exchange. The epidermis is NOT photosynthetic, with the exception of the two guard cells that surround each stoma. The upper epidermis typically has only about half the density of stomata that occur on the lower epidermis, so while transpiration does occur across the upper epidermis, not as much occurs as across the lower. The epidermis is the outer layer of the three layers that make up the skin, the inner layers being the dermis and hypodermis. The epidermis layer provides a barrier to infection from environmental pathogens and regulates the amount of water released from the body into the atmosphere through transepidermal water loss.

Does Leaf Surface Area Affect the Rate of Transpiration in a Plant? Aim: The aim of my investigation is to find out if the leaf surface area affects the rate of transpiration in a plant. Variables: The variables of this experiment are;- * The leaf surface area * Temperature of the surrounding air * The speed and amount of wind * The amount of light Environmental Factors: Temperature of air The temperature of the air affects the rate of transpiration. Where S=the number of stomata, E=total number of epidermal cells in a unit area of the leaf. Oats contain 54,000 per one square inch, but cucumber contains 428,000 per square inch. A study on stomatal index of leaves at different positions and different areas in the same leaf and plant provides very interesting information about the structure, frequency, distribution and ultimately their function. Water is transpired through stomata, but carbon dioxide also must pass through stomata into a leaf for. photosynthesis to occur. There is evidence that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has not. always been the same over the history of life on Earth. How to Calculate Leaf Surface Area. The rate of transpiration is measured as the amount of water lost/ square meter/ minute. Because water evaporates through the many stomata on the leaf surface, the rate of transpiration is directly related to the surface area. To arrive at the rate of transpiration, therefore, you must calculate the leaf surface area of each plant: Because most stomata are found in the lower epidermis, you will determine that surface area. 1  Lay the leaves to be measured on a 1-cm grid and trace their outlines. 2  Count the number of square centimeters. To investigate the relationship among leaf surface area, number of stomata, and the rate of transpiration learning objective 2: To design and conduct an experiment to explore other factors, including different environmental variables, on the rate of transpiration Perhaps there are the same number of stomata on a small leaf as on a large leaf and the space between the stomata increases as the leaf grows. Perhaps larger leaves have more stomata and more stomata are formed in the spaces as a leaf gets bigger. Each of these hypotheses could lead you to a different prediction of the rate of transpiration per cm2 in large compared with small leaves. We would be interested to know how your experiments go. This is an adaptation to check excessive transpiration in these plants. Number of Stomata (Stomatal Frequency): The number of stomata in a definite area of leaf varies from plant to plant. Xerophytes possess larger number of stomata than mesophytes. Number of stomata/sq cm. is 1000 — 60,000 in different plant species. The number of stomta per unit area of leaf is called Stomatal Frequency. Stomata frequency of trees and shrubs is higher than herbs. Stomata nearly occupy one to two percent of total leaf area when fully open. Is there any relationship between the number of stomata and the environment in which the plant species evolved? • Are leaf surface area and the number of stomata related to the rate of transpiration? What might happen to the rate of transpiration if the number of leaves or the size of leaves is reduced? • Do all parts of a plant transpire? Transpiration is a physiological phenomenon in which water is lost from certain surfaces of the plant body in the form of water vapors. This process is essential for the upward movement of water and mineral nutrients.

Do they mean double in volume, double in height, they probably mean something like ‘wait until the dough has increased until you think it is enough’.

So I have always judged the increase by eye and the poke test but unlike your more scientific approach waited for the indentation to stay. 2  Hi Ed, For my calculations I start with an imaginary boule of dough with a height of 10cm.

When you take a boule with a height of 20cm this equals about 16745cm³ which is about 16 liters of dough! So a doubling in diameter equals 8 times the growth in actual volume.

If you are feeling ill, take a look at the following food poisoning duration chart. These symptoms typically last for a few days or longer. Symptoms that last for more than 2 weeks, however, are a sign of chronic diarrhea. Call your doctor if you think that you have chronic diarrhea or if you see blood in your stool. When Will Symptoms Appear? When you were a kid, did you like to chant diarrhea, diarrhea to make your friends laugh? Now you probably associate the word with discomfort and embarrassment because having diarrhea is no fun. But nearly everybody gets it once in a while, usually due to gastrointestinal infections. There are three general classifications of diarrhea defined by how long the condition persists: 2 • Acute Diarrhea. This is when the illness only lasts between several hours to two weeks. According to Medical News Today, acute diarrhea is defined by world guidelines as the presence of three or more abnormally loose or watery stools in the preceding 24 hours. 3 It is usually caused by infection — bacterial, viral or parasitic. 4 Medications, especially antibiotics, are another common cause of acute diarrhea, because they upset the balance of good and bad bacteria in your gut. 5,6 • Persistent Diarrhea. It is when you suffer from diarrhea for two to four weeks. The most common causes of persistent diarrhea are listed below: 7,8 Diarrhea that lasts for more than two days in an adult or one day in a child, or which occurs with an infant. Severe diarrhea. Frequent vomiting. Blood in either stool or vomit. Extreme cramping or abdominal pain. Dehydration, which can include excessive thirst, little urination, sunken eyes, and dizziness. Black or tarry stool. The incubation period for a gastrointestinal infection depends on the particular germ causing it. For example, the Shigella incubation period is usually 2 to 4 days, but the period for viral infections ranges from 4 to 48 hours. Parasitic infections generally have longer incubation periods; for instance, in a Giardia infection, symptoms can take from 1 to 4 weeks to appear. Then, depending on the type of germ and the person's overall health, a diarrheal infection can last for a few days or a few weeks. The word diarrhea with its odd spelling is a near steal from the Greek diarrhoia meaning a flowing through. Diarrhea can be acute, that is, sudden in onset and short-lived, or it may be prolonged. Most acute episodes of diarrhea are due to viral infections and last three to five days. Prolonged diarrhea -- lasting more than four to six weeks -- usually is due to an underlying gastrointestinal disease, the most common of which are diseases that cause inflammation and malabsorption of food. If your sickness does not seem to match one of the five most common types, you may have a rare form of food poisoning. While some of these can last for as little as a day, others (i.e. hepatitis and cyclosporiasis) can last for as long as several months. By narrowing down the foods you ate and your symptoms, you can determine just how long you have to wait to be healthy again. In most cases, you can expect to be feeling better within 10 days. Evaluation by a physician generally is needed if diarrhea is severe, results in dehydration, persists for more than a couple of weeks (chronic diarrhea), or if there is a high fever or blood in the stools. Here are a few types of GI infections that you may have heard about: 1  Salmonella bacteria lead to between 1 and 5 million cases of diarrheal illness in the United States each year. These bacteria, a major cause of food poisoning, are frequently found in raw chicken or eggs.

Most healthy adults may be able to infect other people beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. Children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days. Symptoms start 1 to 4 days after the virus enters the body. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Some people can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. During this time, those persons may still spread the virus to others. The lymph nodes can swell making turning the head painful. The eyes can be sensitive to light. There can be a dry annoying cough. The flu is also contagious the day before the first symptoms begin. The person remains contagious for 5 to 7 days, as long as the body is producing new mucus, and they are also contagious as long as they have a fever. The Flu Is Contagious Most healthy adults may be able to infect other people beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. Children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days. But just because you don't exhibit these symptoms, it doesn't mean you don't have the flu, researchers say. And you could be just as contagious. In fact, their study found that roughly three-quarters of people with seasonal or pandemic flu show either no symptoms or mild ones that aren't usually linked to flu. People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. Most experts think that flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose. Even If You Don't Have Symptoms, You May Still Have The Flu : Shots - Health News Roughly 1 in 5 unvaccinated people had the flu between 2006 and 2011, but only a quarter of them had symptoms, a study found. If you have already been exposed to the flu, but you don't have any symptoms, you can take Tamiflu for up to 6 weeks to help prevent you from getting sick. People often mistake the flu for the common cold, Hayward tells Shots. A lot of the time you may just have a runny nose, a bit of a cough, perhaps a sore throat, he says. But the classic flu symptoms of a sudden fever and muscle aches — the study shows that that very often doesn't happen. And it's often a much more mild illness. Influenza's incubation period is 1-4 days with 2 days being the most common for showing symptoms. There are many viruses that cause cold and flu symptoms that are not the common cold or influenza. If you were exposed to one of those it may take up to 7 days before symptoms appear. Discover how taking Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) within 48 hours of flu onset may help reduce the amount of time you are sick and help prevent the flu. Indications: Tamiflu is a prescription medicine used to treat the flu (influenza) in people 2 weeks of age and older who have had flu symptoms for no more than 2 days.

If autism is caught in infancy, treatment can take full advantage of the young brain’s remarkable plasticity. Although autism is hard to diagnose before 24 months, symptoms often surface between 12 and 18 months. If signs are detected by 18 months of age, intensive treatment may help to rewire the brain and reverse the symptoms. If you notice any of these signs or have concerns about your child's development, talk with his doctor. Signs of autism in babies younger than 12 months old. At this age, picking up on signs of autism involves paying attention to whether your child is meeting developmental milestones. Here are some things to watch for: Doesn't show interest in faces. Doesn't make eye contact, doesn't smile, and may even seem to look right through you. Does My Child Have Autism? Recognizing the Early Signs and Symptoms of Autism. As a parent, you never want to believe that your precious bundle has a problem. But when it comes to autism, catching it early—ideally by the age of eighteen months—makes a huge difference. But no matter your child's age, don't lose hope. It's important to note that, unlike kids with autism, those with AS might show no delays in language development; they usually have good grammar skills and an advanced vocabulary at an early age. However, many do have a language disorder — for instance, a child might be very literal and have trouble using language in a social context. For parents, the first months after learning that their child has a developmental disorder can be emotional, confusing and challenging. For this reason, Autism Speaks has developed the 100 Day Tool Kit, to help families navigate the often-tumultuous first 100 days after a child’s diagnosis. Knowing you have autism may help you understand why you may feel differently or see yourself as being different but it doesn’t have to define you.” Your provider can help with this discussion with your child so ask if you are unsure of where to start or if you are having difficulty describing autism as anything but a disability. We hope this helps give you some ideas on when and how to talk with your child about having an autism diagnosis. Finally, get information and support from credible organizations like Autism Speaks, the Autism Science Foundation, and the Autism Society. If there’s one thing that the statistics tell us, it’s that families with autistic children are not alone. Autism Speaks' multi-year Ad Council public service advertising campaign stresses the importance of recognizing the early signs of autism and seeking early intervention services. Recent research confirms that appropriate screening can determine whether a child is at risk for autism as young as one year. The most recent statistics show that 1 in 68 children are now being diagnosed with autism. While diagnosis is on the rise, a child typically is not diagnosed by a professional until he or she is over two years old. However, there are signs that could indicate your child is on the spectrum as early as six months of age. Signs and symptoms can vary, as can the severity of the symptoms. Be sure to monitor your child’s development, and consult your doctor if anything concerns you. It’s important to note that autism in infants can be recognized by a lack of normal behavior, rather than the presence of strange behaviors. 9. Lack of smiling Rather than describe autism as a disability, think of it as a way to describe the way your child’s brain works. Point out the strengths of having a brain that works this way – “You have a great memory” or “You see details that others miss”. There is no right age to tell your child – it’s more a matter of right developmental level. Kindergarten and 1st grade are a time when kids start to see differences and hear descriptive words to describe or group kids such as the kids who are “busy”, “shy”, “active”.
