Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.","Context_1 : Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as ""histories"" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—""Julius Caesar"", ""Antony and Cleopatra"" and ""Coriolanus""—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy. They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies. Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the ""problem play,"" for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending. The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars. Context_2 : A problem picture is a genre of art popular in late Victorian painting, characterised by the deliberately ambiguous depiction of a key moment in a narrative that can be interpreted in several different ways, or which portrays an unresolved dilemma. It has some relation to the problem play. The viewer of the picture is invited to speculate about several different possible explanations of the scene. The genre has much in common with that of book illustration, then at its most popular, but with the text belonging to the illustration omitted. Context_3 : All's Well, Ends Well 2012 () is a 2012 Hong Kong romantic comedy film directed by Chan Hing-ka and Janet Chun. It is the seventh installment in the ""All's Well, Ends Well"" film series.

It is the fourth instalment in the ""All's Well, Ends Well"" film series, the previous film being ""All's Well, Ends Well 1997"". Context_5 : In Shakespeare studies, the problem plays are three plays that William Shakespeare wrote between the late 1590s and the first years of the seventeenth century: ""All's Well That Ends Well"", ""Measure for Measure"" and ""Troilus and Cressida"". Shakespeare's problem-plays are characterised by their complex and ambiguous tone, which shifts violently between dark, psychological drama and more straightforward comic material; compare tragicomedy. Context_6 : Black-Eyed Susan; or, All in the Downs is a comic play in three acts by Douglas Jerrold. The story concerns a heroic sailor, William, who has been away from England for three years fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. Meanwhile, his wife, Susan, has fallen on hard times and is being harassed by her crooked landlord uncle. A smuggler named Hatchet offers to pay her debts because he wants her for himself; he tries to persuade her that William is dead. Soon after William returns to solve this problem, his drunken, dastardly captain tries to seduce Susan. William, not recognising his captain from behind, strikes him with his cutlass. He is court-martialled for attacking a senior officer and sentenced to be hanged. But it turns out that he had been discharged from the navy before he struck his captain, so all ends well. Much of the humour in the piece centers on the sailor's nautical dialect, combined with his noble character. The play is a nautical melodrama (with all its stock characters) that praises the patriotic British tar (sailor) while critiquing authoritarianism in the British Navy. Aspects of the story were later parodied in ""H.M.S. Pinafore"" (1878). Context_7 : Mrs. Warren's Profession is a play written by George Bernard Shaw in 1893, and first performed in London in 1902. The play is about a former prostitute, now a madam (brothel proprietor), who attempts to come to terms with her disapproving daughter. It is a problem play, offering social commentary to illustrate Shaw's belief that the act of prostitution was not caused by moral failure but by economic necessity. Elements of the play were borrowed from Shaw's 1882 novel ""Cashel Byron's Profession"", about a man who becomes a boxer due to limited employment opportunities. Context_8 : All's Well, Ends Well 2011 is a 2011 Hong Kong romantic comedy film directed by Chan Hing-ka and Janet Chun.

Smartstax also incorporates Monsanto's Acceleron Seed Treatment System which protects against insects at the earliest stages of development. Smartstax is sold under the Genuity (Monsanto) and Mycogen (Dow) brands. Context_8 : The systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a ""whole-plant"" resistance response that occurs following an earlier localized exposure to a pathogen. SAR is analogous to the innate immune system found in animals, and there is evidence that SAR in plants and innate immunity in animals may be evolutionarily conserved. Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in Arabidopsis (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. SAR is important for plants to resist disease, as well as to recover from disease once formed. SAR can be induced by a wide range of pathogens, especially (but not only) those that cause tissue necrosis, and the resistance observed following induction of SAR is effective against a wide range of pathogens, which is why SAR resistance is sometimes called ""broad spectrum."" SAR is associated with the induction of a wide range of genes (so called PR or ""pathogenesis-related"" genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA). The pathogen-induced SA signal activates a molecular signal transduction pathway that is identified by a gene called ""NIM1"", ""NPR1"" or ""SAI1"" (three names for the same gene) in the model genetic system ""Arabidopsis thaliana"". SAR has been observed in a wide range of flowering plants, including dicotyledon and monocotyledon species. SAR can be activated in corn, however, widely adapted commercial like Benzothiadiazole may not be efficient against ""P. sorghi"" causing common rust.

The Dian buried their dead in vertical pit graves. The Dian language was likely one of the Tibeto-Burman languages. The Dian were gradually displaced and assimilated into Han Chinese culture as the Han dynasty expanded towards what is now Yunnan. The Han annexation of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC eventually led to the establishment of the Yizhou commandery. Context_2 : The Han conquest of Nanyue was a military conflict between the Han Empire and the Nanyue kingdom in modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and Northern Vietnam. During the reign of Emperor Wu, the Han forces launched a punitive campaign against Nanyue and conquered it in 111 BC as part of the southward expansion of the Han Dynasty. Context_3 : Xiao He (died 193 BC) was a Chinese statesman of the early Western Han dynasty.

He was then sent to Mount Li to perform hard labour by constructing Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. He later escaped with some men and became the leader of a bandit gang. Ying Bu participated in the insurrection against the Qin dynasty after the Dazexiang Uprising broke out in 209 BC. After the uprising failed, he became part of a rebel force led by Xiang Liang. He assisted Xiang Liang's nephew and successor Xiang Yu in overthrowing the Qin dynasty. After the fall of Qin, he initially fought on Xiang Yu's side in the Chu–Han Contention (206–202 BC), a power struggle for supremacy over China between Xiang Yu and Liu Bang (Emperor Gao). However, later, he defected to Liu Bang's side and helped Liu defeat Xiang Yu and become the emperor. During this period of time, Ying Bu held the title of ""King of Jiujiang"".

It became a National Forest on March 4, 1907. On July 1, 1908 it gave up some acreage to California National Forest. In 1954 it was combined administratively with Shasta National Forest to create Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Trinity National Forest is located overwhelmingly in Trinity County, which has 89.46% of its acreage. In descending order of land area the rest of the counties are Tehama with 7.37%, Shasta with 2.93%, and Humboldt with 0.23%. There are local ranger district offices in Hayfork and Weaverville. Its administrative offices reside in Redding, as part of the combined Shasta-Trinity National Forest. As of 30 September 2008, the Forest has an area of 1,043,677 acres (4,223.61 km²), comprising 47.23% of the combined Shasta-Trinity's total 2,209,832 acres (8,942.87 km²). Context_2 : Bridger National Forest was first established by the U.S. Forest Service on July 1, 1911 in Wyoming with 577580 acre from part of Bonneville National Forest. On May 14, 1923 Bridger was transferred Wyoming National Forest, and the name was discontinued. On March 10, 1943 Wyoming was renamed Bridger. In 1973 Bridger National Forest was administratively combined with Teton National Forest, creating Bridger-Teton National Forest. In descending order of land area, Bridger National Forest lands are located in Sublette, Lincoln, Fremont, and Teton counties. There are local ranger district offices in Afton, Big Piney, Kemmerer, and Pinedale. Its administrative headquarters reside in Jackson, Wyoming as part of the combined Bridger-Teton National Forest. Its current area of 1,736,075 acres (7,025.65 km²) represents 51.02% of the combined Bridger-Teton's area of 3,402,644 acres (13,770.01 km²). The forest includes all of the National Wilderness Preservation System's officially designated Bridger Wilderness. Context_3 : Snoqualmie National Forest is a United States National Forest in the State of Washington. It was established on 1 July 1908, when an area of 961,120 acres (3,889.52 km²) was split from the existing Washington National Forest. Its size was increased on 13 October 1933, when a part of Rainier National Forest was added. In 1974 Snoqualmie was administratively combined with Mount Baker National Forest to make Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. In descending order of land area, Snoqualmie National Forest lies in parts of King, Snohomish, Pierce, and Kittitas counties. There are local ranger district offices in North Bend and Skykomish. Its main base is in Everett, Washington. As of 30 September 2007, it had an area of 1,258,167 acres (5,091.62 km²), representing about 49 percent of the combined forest's total acreage. Context_4 : The Gila National Forest is a protected national forest in New Mexico in the southwestern part of the United States established in 1905. It covers approximately 2710659 acre of public land, making it the sixth largest National Forest in the continental United States. The Forest also manages that part of the Apache National Forest that is in New Mexico which totals an additional 614,202 acres for a total of 3.3 million acres managed by the Gila National Forest. Part of the forest, the Gila Wilderness, was established in 1924 as the first designated wilderness reservation by the U.S. federal government. Aldo Leopold Wilderness and the Blue Range Wilderness are also found within its borders. (The Blue Range Primitive Area lies within Arizona in the neighboring Apache National Forest.) Context_5 : The Preserve at Sharp Mountain (also called The Sharp Mountain Preserve) is a nature-based community located near Jasper, Georgia in Pickens County. It is one of three mountain communities in Pickens County, and the only one dedicated to maintaining its natural amenities. There are 12 mi of paved roads running through the community, but the population density is intentionally low (approximately 300 lots over 1600 acre ranging in size from a minimum of 3 acre to a maximum of 37 acres.) The Preserve at Sharp Mountain was named the ""Best Community for Outdoor Lovers"" by Pinnacle Living magazine, Unlike many planned communities, the Preserve at Sharp Mountain does not have swimming pools and tennis courts with club houses or golf courses. Instead, the Preserve at Sharp Mountain offers many acres of green space, hiking and nature trails, a nature pavilion, waterfalls, a bird sanctuary, a butterfly garden and various nature parks. The community is gated to restrict use of its 12 mi of privately owned roads to those living in the community. The Preserve at Sharp Mountain was developed by Four Seasons originally, which later became Naterra Land. Naterra's stated goal in all of its projects is ""to better connect people with nature."" Naterra Land sold out all of its inventory in the Preserve, and control of the community is now governed by a Property Owners' Association (POA). In 2011, the Preserve Association switched from being an HOA (Home Owners' Association) to being a POA (Property Owners' Association), each being viewed differently under Georgia law. In 2008 the Preserve became a recognized member of the national Firewise communities program and is one of the 13 in Georgia. Context_6 : The Coconino National Forest is a 1.856-million acre (751,000 ha) United States National Forest located in northern Arizona in the vicinity of Flagstaff. Originally established in 1898 as the ""San Francisco Mountains National Forest Reserve"", the area was designated a U.S. National Forest in 1908 when the San Francisco Mountains National Forest Reserve was merged with lands from other surrounding forest reserves to create the Coconino National Forest. Today, the Coconino National Forest contains diverse landscapes, including deserts, ponderosa pine forests, flatlands, mesas, alpine tundra, and ancient volcanic peaks. The forest surrounds the towns of Sedona and Flagstaff and borders four other national forests; the Kaibab National Forest to the west and northwest, the Prescott National Forest to the southwest, the Tonto National Forest to the south, and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest to the southeast. The forest contains all or parts of ten designated wilderness areas, including the Kachina Peaks Wilderness, which includes the summit of the San Francisco Peaks. The headquarters are in Flagstaff. There are local ranger district offices in Flagstaff, Happy Jack, and Sedona. Context_7 : The Cibola National Forest (pronounced SEE-bo-lah) is a 1,633,783 acre (6,611.7 km2) United States National Forest in New Mexico, USA. The name Cibola is thought to be the original Zuni Indian name for their pueblos or tribal lands. The name was later interpreted by the Spanish to mean, ""buffalo."" The forest is disjointed with lands spread across central and northern New Mexico, west Texas and Oklahoma. The Cibola National Forest is divided into four Ranger Districts: the Sandia, Mountainair, Mt. Taylor, and Magdalena. The Forest includes the San Mateo, Magdalena, Datil, Bear, Gallina, Manzano, Sandia, Mt. Taylor, and Zuni Mountains of west-central New Mexico. The Forest also manages four National Grasslands that stretch from northeastern New Mexico eastward into the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. The Cibola National Forest and Grassland is administered by Region 3 of the United States Forest Service from offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Elevation ranges from 5,000 ft (1,500 m) to 11,301 ft (3,445 m). (The preceding figures do not include any of the four National Grasslands mentioned below, which are detailed in their individual articles.) The descending order of Cibola National Forest acres (not counting the three Grassland areas) by county are: Socorro, Cibola, McKinley, Catron, Torrance, Bernalillo, Sandoval County, New Mexico, Lincoln, Sierra, and Valencia counties in New Mexico. The Cibola National Forest currently has 137,701 acres designated as Wilderness. In addition to these acres, it has 246,000 acres classified as Inventoried Roadless Areas pursuant to the Roadless Area Conservation Rule. Context_8 : The Palouse Forest Reserve and after March 4, 1907, the Palouse National Forest was established by Presidential Proclamation (34 U.S. Statutes at Large 3293) on March 2, 1907 and was one of President Theodore Roosevelt's Midnight forests, created before the federal law banning new forest reserves in six western states, including Idaho, became effective. The conventional wisdom has the name ‘palouse’ being derived from the French term for the large treeless plain region in eastern Washington stretching into Idaho: the Palouse, a word meaning grassy spot or place. However, Boone says that the name could originate from the name of a major village of Palouse Indians, Palus, located at the confluence of the Palouse and Snake Rivers. 'Palus' is the Sachapin Indian word for “something sticking down in the water,” in this case the something was a large rock, thought to be a beaver’s heart, and which had an important religious significance for the Palouse Indians. The Palouse National Forest had its administrative headquarters in the town of Wallace, Idaho for its 15-month existence and was administered by the U.S. Forest Service with 194404 acre . With the issuance of Executive Order 843 by President Roosevelt on June 26, 1908, with an effective date of July 1, 1908, the entire forest was absorbed by the Coeur d'Alene National Forest and the area ceased to be an independently administered national forest. The lands of the former Palouse National Forest were then administered as part of the Coeur d’Alene National Forest for three years before being combined with other lands to establish the St. Joe National Forest on July 1, 1911. The area of the former Palouse National Forest formed the western portion of the St. Joe National Forest. Once transferred in 1911, the area of the Palouse National Forest became the Palouse Ranger District of the St. Joe National Forest and is still considered part of the St. Joe National Forest. However, it has been administered by the Clearwater National Forest since the 1973 administrative merger of the Kaniksu National Forest, Coeur d’Alene, and St. Joe National Forests into the Idaho Panhandle National Forests. Context_9 : The Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest in northern Georgia comprises two United States National Forests, the Oconee National Forest and Chattahoochee National Forest.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.","Context_1 : The first Battle of Reading was a battle on 4 January 871 at Reading in what is now the English county of Berkshire. It was one of a series of battles, with honours to both sides, that took place following an invasion of the then kingdom of Wessex by an army of Danes led by Bagsecg and Halfdan Ragnarsson in an attempt to conquer Wessex. Both battle and campaign are described in the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"", and this account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of the town of Reading. Context_2 : Ímar (Old Norse: ""Ívarr"" ; died c. 873) was a Viking leader in Ireland and Scotland in the mid-late ninth century who founded the Uí Ímair dynasty, and whose descendants would go on to dominate the Irish Sea region for several centuries. He was the son of the king of Lochlann, identified in the non-contemporary ""Fragmentary Annals of Ireland"" as Gofraid. The ""Fragmentary Annals"" name Auisle and Amlaíb Conung as his brothers. Another Viking leader, Halfdan Ragnarsson, is considered by some scholars to be another brother. The Irish Annals title Amlaíb, Ímar and Auisle ""kings of the foreigners"". Modern scholars use the title ""kings of Dublin"" after the Viking settlement which formed the base of their power. Some scholars consider Ímar to be identical to Ivar the Boneless, a Viking commander of the Great Heathen Army named in contemporary English sources who also appears in the Icelandic sagas as a son of the legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok. Context_3 : Auisle or Óisle (Old Norse: ""Ásl ""or"" Auðgísl"" ; died c. 867) was a Viking leader in Ireland and Scotland in the mid-late ninth century. He was the son of the king of Lochlann, identified in the non-contemporary ""Fragmentary Annals of Ireland"" as Gofraid, and brother of Amlaíb Conung and Ímar, the latter of whom founded the Uí Ímair dynasty, and whose descendants would go on to dominate the Irish Sea region for several centuries. Another Viking leader, Halfdan Ragnarsson, is sometimes considered a brother. The Irish Annals title Auisle, Ímar and Amlaíb ""kings of the foreigners"". Modern scholars use the title ""kings of Dublin"" after the Viking settlement which formed the base of their power. Context_4 : The Battle of Strangford Lough was fought in 877 between two groups of rival Vikings described by the Irish Annals as the ""fair heathens"" and the ""dark heathens"". The ""Annals of Ulster"" describe ""Albann"", a figure usually identified with Halfdan Ragnarsson, a leader of the Great Heathen Army, as king of the ""dark heathens"", and ""Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib"" identifies Bárid mac Ímair, King of Dublin as the leader of the ""fair heathens"". All accounts agree Halfdan was killed in the battle, and ""Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib"" adds that Bárid was wounded in it. Context_5 : Ivar the Boneless (Old Norse: ""Ívarr hinn Beinlausi"" ; ) was a Viking leader and a commander who invaded what is now England. According to the ""Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok"", he was the son of Ragnar Lodbrok and Aslaug. His brothers included Björn Ironside, Halfdan Ragnarsson, Hvitserk, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye and Ubba. Context_6 : The Great Viking Army or Great Danish Army, known by the Anglo-Saxons as the Great Heathen Army (OE: ""mycel hæþen here""), was a coalition of Norse warriors, originating from Denmark (and likely also from Sweden and Norway) who came together under a unified command to invade the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that constituted England in AD 865. Context_7 : Halfdan Ragnarsson (Old Norse: ""Hálfdan"" ; or ""Healfdene""; Old Irish: ""Albann"" ; died 877) was a Viking leader and a commander of the Great Heathen Army which invaded the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England, starting in 865. According to the tradition recorded in the Norse sagas he was one of the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, and his brothers included Björn Ironside, Ivar the Boneless, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye and Ubba. He was the first Viking King of Northumbria and a pretender to the throne of Kingdom of Dublin. He died at the Battle of Strangford Lough in 877 trying to press his Irish claim. Context_8 : Amlaíb Conung (Old Norse: ""Óláfr"" ; died c. 874) was a Viking leader in Ireland and Scotland in the mid-late ninth century. He was the son of the king of Lochlann, identified in the non-contemporary ""Fragmentary Annals of Ireland"" as Gofraid, and brother of Auisle and Ímar, the latter of whom founded the Uí Ímair dynasty, and whose descendants would go on to dominate the Irish Sea region for several centuries. Another Viking leader, Halfdan Ragnarsson, is considered by some scholars to be another brother. The Irish Annals title Amlaíb, Ímar and Auisle ""kings of the foreigners"". Modern scholars use the title ""kings of Dublin"" after the Viking settlement which formed the base of their power. The epithet ""Conung"" is derived from the Old Norse ""konungr"" and simply means ""king"". Some scholars consider Amlaíb to be identical to Olaf the White, a Viking sea-king who features in the ""Landnámabók"" and other Icelandic sagas. Context_9 : The Battle of Marton or Meretum took place on approximately 22 March 871 at a place recorded as Marton, perhaps in Wiltshire or Dorset. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the battle took place ""about two months"" after a prior loss to the Danes at the Battle of Basing, in which both sides suffered heavy losses. King Æthelred of Wessex and Prince Alfred fought against the Danes, who were possibly under the leadership of King Halfdan Ragnarsson, who had commanded many of the earlier battles that year. The Chronicle tells us that the forces were split in two and that the Danes were initially put to flight, but at the end of the day and after ""much slaughter"" the Danes remained masters of the field.

Context_5 : An infield hit is an outcome in baseball in which the batted ball stays in the infield but neither the batter nor any of the runners are put out. If the batter and the runners reach safely due to an error, it is not considered an infield hit. Runners normally only advance one base in an infield hit, as opposed to a single where the runner from second base frequently comes in to score. Ichiro Suzuki is particularly noted for his infield hits. Context_6 : Winner Stays On is the fourth studio album by London-based grime music collective Roll Deep, it was released on 8 November 2010.

Context_7 : The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee. The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee. The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort. Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as ""LD"" which is part of the Cincinnati Division. From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee. At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash ""Amqui"" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal. Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as ""SA"" and operates on AAR58. There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui. From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track). There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1. Few more miles southward, the next major location appears. At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal. From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago. The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track. From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track. From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike. The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of ""0BA"" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal. At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard. Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals. This location is known as North Radnor. The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta. The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures. The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main. Both lines remain double track for a while. The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0. Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south. From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge. At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40. From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10. After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown. On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present. This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it. The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye. The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic. The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal. The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0. The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 ""11th Avenue"" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track. The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at ""Shops"". Now speed has been increased. The line is still double track until ""Sellars"", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher. For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements. The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3. The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines. The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed. The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel. Crew change usually occurs at the ""walkway"" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower. This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins. Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated. At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now. There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3. About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double. About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names). When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as ""Long Lead"". And now, the Terminal splits into two parts. The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood. The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while. This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line. The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2. Speed is now increased to 40. Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance. Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line. At 00J3.6 known as A-1. Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9). Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line. At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, ""SC"". At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill. There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track. And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad. Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard. Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10. Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192. The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use. The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs. At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1. Speed is now at 40. 2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present. This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main. There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track. Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains. This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent. From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip. The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood. Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher. The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important.

Context_7 : An industry analyst performs primary and secondary market research within an industry such as information technology, consulting or insurance. Analysts assess sector trends, create segment taxonomies, size markets, prepare forecasts, and develop industry models. Industry analysts usually work for research and advisory services firms, and some analysts also perform advisory (consulting) services. Typically, analysts specialize in a single segment or sub-segment, researching the broad development of the market rather than focusing on specific publicly traded companies, equities, investments, or associated financial opportunities as a financial analyst might. Context_8 : In investment portfolio construction, an investor or analyst is faced with determining which asset classes, such as domestic fixed income, domestic equity, foreign fixed income, and foreign equity, to invest in and what proportion of the total portfolio should be of each asset class. Harry Markowitz (1959) first described a method for constructing a portfolio with optimal risk/return characteristics. His portfolio optimization method finds the minimum risk portfolio with a given expected return. Because the Markowitz or Mean-Variance Efficient Portfolio is calculated from the sample mean and covariance, which are likely different from the population mean and covariance, the resulting investment portfolio may allocate too much weight to assets with better estimated than true risk/return characteristics. To account for the uncertainty of the sample estimates, a financial analyst can create many alternative efficient frontiers based on resampled versions of the data. Each resampled dataset will result in a different set of Markowitz efficient portfolios. These efficient frontiers of portfolios can then averaged to create a resampled efficient frontier. The appropriate compromise between the investor's Risk aversion and desired return will then guide the financial analyst to choose a portfolio from the set of resampled efficient frontier portfolios. Since such a portfolio is different from the Markowitz efficient portfolio it will have suboptimal risk/return characteristics with respect to the sample mean and covariance, but optimal characteristics when averaged over the many possible values of the unknown true mean and covariance.

Context_2 : Participatory economics, often abbreviated pare-con, is an economic system based on participatory decision making as the primary economic mechanism for allocation in society. In the system the say in decision-making is proportional to the impact on a person or group of people. Participatory economics is a form of decentralized economic planning and socialism involving the common ownership of the means of production. It is a proposed alternative to contemporary capitalism and central planning. This economic model is primarily associated with political theorist Michael Albert and economist Robin Hahnel, who describe participatory economics as an anarchist economic vision.

Complementary holism does not rest on an ""a priori"" assumption that a particular sphere is the base and all else is superstructure, as historical materialism does, but rather that we must take an empirical look at society's development and assess how it has been shaped by all social forces. Complementary holists agree with Marxists that economics is important to human and social development, just as they do with anarchists in regard to the State or with feminists in regard to gender inequality, but they assert that Marxists see economics, or class conflict, as the sole factor, and they don't believe that economics is always the most important factor.

It was built by U.S. Army troops under the command of Lt. John Mullan, between the spring of 1859 and summer 1860. It led from Fort Benton, which at the time was in the Dakota Territory, then Idaho Territory from July 1863, and Montana Territory beginning in May 1864, and the navigational head of the Missouri River (and once farthest inland port in the world). The road connected to Fort Walla Walla, Washington Territory, near the Columbia River. The road previewed the route approximately followed of modern-day Interstate 15 and Interstate 90 through present-day Montana, Idaho, and Washington. Context_2 : Fort Benton is a city in and the county seat of Chouteau County, Montana, United States. Established in 1846, a full generation before the U.S. Civil War, Fort Benton is one of the oldest settlements in the American West; in contrast, many other places—including large cities today—were settled in the late 1860s, 1870s, or 1880s. The city's waterfront area, the most important aspect of its 19th-century growth, was designated the Fort Benton Historic District, a National Historic Landmark, in 1961.

The first Fort Walla Walla was established July 1856, by Lieutenant Colonel Edward Steptoe, 9th Infantry Regiment. A second Fort Walla Walla was occupied September 23, 1856. The third and permanent military Fort Walla Walla was built in 1858 and adjoined Steptoeville, now Walla Walla, Washington, a community that had grown up around the second fort. An Executive Order on May 7, 1859 declared the fort a military reservation containing 640 acres devoted to military purposes and a further 640 acres each of hay and timber reserves. On September 28, 1910 soldiers from the 1st Cavalry lowered the flag closing the fort. In 1917, the fort briefly reopened to train men of the First Battalion Washington Field Artillery in support of action in World War I. In 1921, the fort and property were turned over to the Veterans Administration where 15 original buildings from the military era remain. Today, the complex contains a park, a museum, and the Jonathan M. Wainright Memorial VA Medical Center.

Context_7 : The Fort Walla Walla–Fort Colville Military Road was built in June 1859 to connect the Walla Walla area with its fairly easy access to the Columbia River to the mountainous area of the Huckleberry and Selkirk Mountains of current Northeast Washington and the Inland Northwest. Brigadier General William S. Harney, commander of the Department of Oregon, opened up the district north of the Snake River to settlers in 1858 and ordered Brevet Major Pinkney Lugenbeel, 9th Infantry Regiment (United States) to establish a U.S. Army post to restrain the Indians lately hostile to the U.S. Army's Northwest Division and to protect miners who flooded into the area after first reports of gold in the area appeared in Western Washington newspapers in July 1855. It was common practice to use existing Indian trails to develop military roads, and only make necessary improvements for the movement of artillery or supply trains. Brevet Major Lugenbeel followed the long established Indian trail, then Hudson Bay Company brigade trail from the U.S. Fort Walla Walla area to Hudson Bay Company Fort Colvile, but had to leave the trail at current Orin-Rice Road, two miles south of Colville, where the southernmost land claims of the Hudson Bay Company fort began. Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens and the U.S. Army were ordered by the United States Department of State to honor land ownership claims by the Hudson Bay Company.

It took place in present-day southeastern Washington state, near the town of Walla Walla, and was one of the most notorious episodes in the U.S. settlement of the Pacific Northwest. The event was the climax of several years of complex interaction between Whitman, who had helped lead the first wagon train to cross Oregon's Blue Mountains and reach the Columbia River via the Oregon Trail, his wife and fellow missionary Narcissa, and the local Native Americans. The story of the massacre shocked the United States Congress into action concerning the future territorial status of the Oregon Country. The Oregon Territory was established on August 14, 1848.

Wheels gave new abilities to the C64 and 128: the ability to open several, movable, resizable windows on the desktop and limited graphical web browsing (and limited server abilities.) At the core of the Wheels OS was the new Dashboard and Toolbox. The Dashboard was the name for the new desktop environment which made using the C64/128 similar to using modern Mac or Windows operating systems with icons and a menu bar. The Toolbox was the replacement for the GEOS Configure app. Context_2 : The 6526/8521 Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) was an integrated circuit made by MOS Technology. It served as an I/O port controller for the 6502 family of microprocessors, providing for parallel and serial I/O capabilities as well as timers and a Time-of-Day (TOD) clock. The device's most prominent use was in the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128(D), each of which included two CIA chips. The Commodore 1570 and Commodore 1571 floppy disk drives contained one CIA each. The Amiga home computers employed two and Commodore 1581 floppy disk drive one 8520 chip, which is functionally equivalent to 6526/8521 except the simplified TOD circuitry. Context_3 : Mattel, Inc.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.","Context_1 : The 2007 Atlantic hurricane season was an active Atlantic hurricane season, although most of the storms were weak and short-lived. However, the 2007 season was the first season to feature more than one Category 5 landfalling hurricane, a feat that would not be matched until 2017. It produced 17 tropical cyclones, 15 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes. It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first tropical cyclone, Subtropical Storm Andrea, developed on May 9, while the last storm, Tropical Storm Olga, dissipated on December 13. The most intense hurricane, Dean, is tied for the eighth most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as the third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall. The season was one of only six on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category 5 hurricane. It was the second on record in which an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day. September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low. Aside from hurricanes Dean and Felix, none of the storms in the season exceeded Category 1 intensity. Context_2 : The Timeline of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season documents the formations, strengthenings, weakenings, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations of the season's tropical and subtropical storms. The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history. The season saw a record twenty-eight tropical or subtropical storms of which a record four storms achieved Category 5 status. Officially beginning on June 1, 2005, and lasting until November 30, the 2005 season persisted into January 2006 due to continued storm activity. Context_3 : The 1952 Atlantic hurricane season was the last Atlantic hurricane season to name tropical cyclones using the phonetic alphabet. It was a near normal Atlantic hurricane season, although it was the least active since 1946. The season officially started on June 15; however, a pre-season unnamed storm formed on Groundhog Day, becoming the only storm on record in the month of February. The other six tropical cyclones were named using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, the first of which formed on August 18. The final storm of the season dissipated on October 28, two and a half weeks before the season officially ended on November 15. Context_4 : The 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was an active Atlantic hurricane season with tropical activity before and after the official bounds of the season – the first such occurrence in 49 years. The season produced 21 tropical cyclones, of which 16 developed into named storms; seven cyclones attained hurricane status, of which three reached major hurricane status. With sixteen storms, the season was tied for the sixth most active Atlantic hurricane season on record. The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Isabel, which reached Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale northeast of the Lesser Antilles; Isabel later struck North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane, causing $3.6 billion in damage (2003 USD, $  USD) and a total of 51 deaths across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Context_5 : The 1890 Atlantic hurricane season is tied for the third least active hurricane season on record, behind 1914 and 1930. The first system was initially observed on May 27 and the last storm, Hurricane Four, dissipated over Central America on November 1. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. The first storm moved slowly north-northwestward, bringing heavy rains and extensive flooding to Cuba, which caused at least three fatalities and at least $1 million (1890 USD) in damage. It dissipated in the Gulf of Mexico on May 29. Tropical cyclogenesis went dormant for nearly two and a half months, until another system was observed near the Windward Islands on August 18. It traversed the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, grazing the Yucatan Peninsula and making landfall in Louisiana before dissipating on August 28. Impact from the storm was minimal. Context_6 : The 1983 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active Atlantic hurricane season in 53 years, during which four tropical cyclones formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1983, and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally limit the period of each year when tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic. The first named storm, Hurricane Alicia, formed on August 15. The last storm of the season, Tropical Storm Dean, dissipated on September 30. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations during the season. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned upon. Context_7 : The 1986 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1986, and lasted until November 30, 1986. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. During the 1986 season, the first subtropical depression formed in the first week of June, while the last tropical cyclone dissipated at the end of the third week of November. The 1986 season had lower than average activity because of an ongoing El Niño event, and was the least active season in the North Atlantic since the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season. This was also the first season since 1972 to have no major hurricanes. Earl was the strongest hurricane of the season, reaching Category 2 status. Few storms caused significant damage; Hurricane Bonnie caused heavy rains and flooding across southeast Texas when it made landfall near Sea Rim State Park. Hurricane Charley caused limited damage in North Carolina and Massachusetts, but crossed the Atlantic as an extratropical cyclone and caused considerable damage in the British Isles. Context_8 : The 1930 Atlantic hurricane season was the second least active Atlantic hurricane season on record – behind only 1914 – with only three systems reaching tropical storm intensity. Of those three, two reached hurricane status, both of which also became major hurricanes, Category 3 or higher storms on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The first system developed in the central Atlantic Ocean on August 21. Later that month, a second storm, the Dominican Republic hurricane, formed on August 29. It peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h). The third and final storm dissipated on October 21. Context_9 : The 1914 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active Atlantic hurricane season on record, with only one known tropical storm. Although hurricane season typically encompasses a much larger time-span, actual activity was confined to the middle of September. The only tropical cyclone of the year developed in the region of The Bahamas on September 15 and drifted northwestward, moving inland over Florida and Georgia. Thorough warnings before the storm prevented any major damage. The 1914 season is one of only two that did not produce any hurricanes (the other being the 1907 season). Due to the lack of modern technology, including satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and an additional tropical depression may have existed in late October. Additionally, this was the first hurricane season to take place during World War I. Context_10 : The 1983 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active Atlantic hurricane season in 53 years, during which only four tropical storms formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1983, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most storms form in the Atlantic basin. The season had very little activity, with only seven tropical depressions, four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher. This led to the lowest Accumulated Cyclone Energy count since 1950, but not since 1900. fact_1 : The 1890 Atlantic hurricane season is tied for the third least active hurricane season on record, behind 1914 and 1930. fact_2 : The 1914 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active Atlantic hurricane season on record, with only one known tropical storm.

Context_3 : The Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford, commonly known as the d.school, is a design thinking institute based in Stanford University. Bernard Roth, co-founder of the Stanford d.school describes ""Self-Image By Design"" thus, ""In the Stanford d.school we attempt to bring students through a series of experiences that change their self-image so that they think of themselves as being more creative. We call this boosting their ""creative confidence"". Michael C. Jensen, Werner Erhard, and their associates use a similar concept in leadership training; they call it 'changing the context'. Others call these types of changes 'reframing' or 'changing frameworks'. Whatever it is called, the psychological milieu in which we operate is important because it acts as a hidden arbitrator in how we approach many aspects of our lives."" According to the ""New York Times"", the school has become one of the most highly sought destinations at Stanford. Context_4 : The Amazonas State University (Portuguese: ""Universidade do Estado do Amazonas"" , UEA) is a Brazilian public university operated by the state of Amazonas, located in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.

Flavell earned his MA from Clark University in 1952 and in 1955 he earned his Ph.D. Through the discovery of new developmental phenomena and analysis of the theories of Jean Piaget, Flavell shifted the direction of developmental psychology in the United States. Context_8 : Apurinã (Ipurina) is a Southern Maipurean language spoken by the Apurinã people of the Amazon basin. It has an active–stative syntax. Apurinã is a Portuguese word used to describe the Popikariwakori people and the language they speak (Facundes 34, 2000). Apurinã indigenous communities are predominantly found along the Purus river in the Northwestern Amazon region in Brazil, in the Amazonas state (Pickering 2, 2009). Its population is currently spread over twenty-seven different indigenous lands along the Purus river (Apurinã PIB). with an estimated population of 9,500 people in total. It is predicted however that less than 30% of the Apurinã population is able to speak the language fluently (Facundes 35, 2000). A definite number of speakers cannot be firmly determined due to a regional scattered presence of its people. The spread of Apurinã speakers to different regions was due initially to conflict or disease, which consequently led natives to lose the ability to speak the language due to lack of practice and interactions with other communities. Secondly, as a consequence of violence and oppression towards indigenous people, some natives and descendants choose to not identify themselves as indigenous further reducing the number of people that are categorized as speaking the language (Facundes 23, 2000). The consequence of this low transmission and cultivation of the language results is the risk of endangerment. The endangerment level of Apurinã is currently at level 3 (Facundes 4, 2000), meaning that although adults still speak the language, children are no longer being exposed to it and are being taught Portuguese or Spanish instead. This could consequently lead to a further reduction in the number of people that speak the language over the years and eventually lead it go become extinct. Context_9 : The Federal University of Amazonas (Portuguese: ""Universidade Federal do Amazonas"" , UFAM) is a public university located in Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.","Context_1 : Mesoamerican pyramids or pyramid-shaped structures form a prominent part of ancient Mesoamerican architecture. Although similar in shape or form, these structures bear only a very weak architectural resemblance to Egyptian pyramids. The Mesoamerican examples are usually step pyramids with temples on top – more akin to the ziggurats of Mesopotamia than to the pyramids of Ancient Egypt. The Mesoamerican region's largest pyramid by volume – indeed, the largest in the world by volume – is the Great Pyramid of Cholula, in the Mexican state of Puebla. Some classic Mesoamerican pyramids are littered with stories about the Hero Twins, the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl, Mesoamerican creation myths, ritualistic sacrifice, etc. written in the form of hieroglyphs on the rises of the steps of the pyramids, on the walls, and on the sculptures contained within. Context_2 : Occurring at about 450 BCE, Herodotus—a Greek historian—called Egypt the “Gift of the Nile” because ancient Egyptian civilization depended on the resources from the river so they could continue living in that vicinity. Beyond the Nile River is the Sahara Desert, and since it almost impossible to grow food in the desert, very few people lived far from the river itself. People that were settled close to the banks of the Nile shared the same language and also worshipped similar gods. ""Hymn to The Nile"" is a tune that was created and sang by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization. Because the ancient Egyptians had relied on this miracle river, Egypt was the “Gift of the Nile.” Context_3 : Artemisia I of Caria (Ancient Greek: Ἀρτεμισία ; Persian: آرتمیس‎ ‎ ; fl. 480 BCE) was a Greek queen of the ancient Greek city-state of Halicarnassus and of the nearby islands of Kos, Nisyros and Kalymnos, within the Achaemenid satrapy of Caria, in about 480 BCE. She fought as an ally of Xerxes I, King of Persia against the independent Greek city states during the second Persian invasion of Greece. She personally commanded her contribution of five ships at the naval battle of Artemisium and in the naval Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE. She is mostly known through the writings of Herodotus, himself a native of Halicarnassus, who praises her courage and the respect in which Xerxes held her. Context_4 : P.A.S.A. Irodotos F.C., short for ""Podosferikos Athlitikos Syllogos Alikarnassou Irodotos"" (Greek: Ποδοσφαιρικός Αθλητικός Σύλλογος Αλικαρνασσού Ηρόδοτος, transliterated ""Irodotos Football Sports Club of Halicarnassus"" ) and also simply known as Irodotos, is a Greek football club, based in Nea Alikarnassos, Heraklion. The club is named after the ancient historian Herodotus, descended from Halicarnassus, Asia Minor, whose bust is also used as the club logo. Irodotos was established in 1932 by refugees from Asia Minor (and specifically the site of modern Bodrum, then still called Halicarnassus), who were displaced following the Greco-Turkish War in 1922. By acclamation, Irodotos is considered the third most successful club in Heraklion in terms of achievements, due to its consistent presence in the Second and Third national divisions, but has maintained a considerable fan base, and a longstanding rivalry with local ex-Superleague side OFI, despite the fact the two haven't met in national competitions for almost 30 years. The club currently administers amateur men's football and basketball departments, while in the past it also had departments for wrestling, cycling, women's football and athletics. Its colours are blue and white. Context_5 : Panyassis of Halicarnassus, sometimes known as Panyasis (Ancient Greek: Πανύασις ), was a 5th-century BC Greek epic poet from Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey). Context_6 : The Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt. Context_7 : Phanes of Halicarnassus (Greek: Φάνης ) was a wise council man, a tactician, and a mercenary from Halicarnassus, serving the Egyptian pharaoh Amasis II (570–526 BC). Most of what history recounts of Phanes is from the account of Herodotus in his grand historical text, ""The Histories"". According to Herodotus, Phanes of Halicarnassus was ""a resourceful man and a brave fighter"" serving Amasis II on matters of state, and was well connected within the Egyptian pharaoh's troops. Phanes of Halicarnassus was also very well respected within the military and royal community of Egypt. Context_8 : The Herodotus Machine was a machine described by Herodotus, a Greek historian born in Halicarnassus, Caria (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey). Herodotus claims this invention enabled the Ancient Egyptians to construct the pyramids. The contraption supposedly allowed workers to lift heavy building materials. Herodotus is believed to have encountered the device while traveling through Egypt. With limited reference and no true schematics, this machine has stimulated many historians' theories of how the Ancient Egyptians were able to create pyramids. Context_9 : Bodrum (] ) is a district and a port city in Muğla Province, in the southwestern Aegean Region of Turkey. It is located on the southern coast of Bodrum Peninsula, at a point that checks the entry into the Gulf of Gökova, and is also the center of the eponymous district. The city was called Halicarnassus of Caria in ancient times and was famous for housing the Mausoleum of Mausolus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Built by the Knights Hospitaller in the 15th century, Bodrum Castle, overlooks the harbour and the marina. The castle grounds include a Museum of Underwater Archaeology and hosts several cultural festivals throughout the year. The city had a population of 36,317 in 2012. It takes 50 minutes via boat to reach Kos from Bodrum, with services running multiple times a day by at least three operators. Context_10 : Herodotus ( ; Ancient Greek: Ἡρόδοτος , ""Hêródotos"", ] ) was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC ( 484– 425 BC), a contemporary of Thucydides, Socrates, and Euripides. He is often referred to as ""The Father of History"", a title first conferred by Cicero; he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigation—specifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. fact_1 :  Herodotus claims this invention enabled the Ancient Egyptians to construct the pyramids. fact_2 : The Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.","Context_1 : In basketball, a personal foul is a breach of the rules that concerns illegal personal contact with an opponent. It is the most common type of foul in basketball. A foul out occurs when a player exceeds his or her personal foul limit for a game and is disqualified from participation in the remainder of the game. Context_2 : In basketball, a flop is an intentional fall by a player after little or no physical contact by an opposing player in order to draw a personal foul call by an official against the opponent. The move is sometimes called ""acting"", as in ""acting as if he was fouled"". Because it is inherently designed to deceive the official, flopping is generally considered to be unsportsmanlike. Nonetheless, it is widely practiced and even perfected by many professional players. The player that commits the act is referred to as a ""flopper"". Context_3 : In basketball, a flagrant foul is a serious personal foul. A foul is considered flagrant when it involves excessive or violent contact that could injure the fouled player. A flagrant foul may be unintentional or purposeful; the latter type is simultaneously known as an ""intentional foul"" in the NBA. However, most intentional fouls are not considered ""flagrant"" and are performed safely as a necessity for time management. Context_4 : Norman ""Norm"" Grekin (June 22, 1930 – September 29, 1981) was an American professional basketball player. Grekin was selected in the 1953 NBA draft by the Philadelphia Warriors after a collegiate career at La Salle. He played in his only career game on October 31, 1953. He recorded one personal foul. Context_5 : Ayuba Suleiman Diallo (17011773), also known as Job ben Solomon, was a famous Muslim who was a victim of the Atlantic slave trade.

Context_7 : In basketball, a technical foul (also colloquially known as a ""T"" or a ""Tech"") is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact during the course of play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player. The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the NBA, and potentially so in the NBA).

Context_10 : Avitus of Braga (Latin Avitus Bracarensis) was an early fifth-century literary priest of Braga (Portugal), who travelled to consult with Augustine and attend the Council of Jerusalem (415) that found against Pelagius. He is remembered for having produced a Latin translation of the first-person account of the miraculous finding of Saint Stephen's tomb near Jerusalem in 415, which he prefaced by a general letter. His personal concern was embodied in relics of the Protomartyr, which would have encouraged the pilgrimage trade at Braga and which he entrusted to Paulus Orosius, also of Braga, to deliver there. Orosius, however, reaching Majorca and hearing daunting news of conditions in Hispania, which was disordered by the invasion of the Vandals, left the relics, which have disappeared, and returned to North Africa. fact_1 : Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal That Rocked the NBA is an autobiography written by former National Basketball Association (NBA) referee Tim Donaghy and published by Florida-based VTi-Group, Inc. in December, 2009. fact_2 : Tim Donaghy ( ; born January 7, 1967) is a former professional basketball referee who worked in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 13 seasons from 1994 to 2007.

Although there has been no one term consistently used to describe this type of recording, the genre predates the use of the term ""concept album"" by several decades, dating back to the era of 78-rpm records with such original works as Gordon Jenkins' ""Manhattan Tower"" (1946, expanded in 1956) and ""The Letter"" (1959) starring Judy Garland, and Stan Freberg's ""Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America, Volume One: The Early Years"" (1961). On most contemporary concept albums, the performers or bands sing as themselves, whereas on an album musical the performers are playing characters in a story. Context_2 : Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. Context_3 : Evo: The Last Gasp of the Dinosaurs is a German-style board game for three to five players, designed by Philippe Keyaerts and published by Eurogames. The game won the ""GAMES Magazine"" award for ""Game of the year 2002"" and was nominated for the Origins Award for ""Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game 2000"".

Qwirkle is considered by MindWare to be its most awarded game of all time. In 2011, Qwirkle won the Spiel des Jahres, widely considered the most prestigious award in the board and card game industry. A sequel, Qwirkle Cubes, was released by Mindware in 2009. Context_5 : Music hall is a type of British theatrical entertainment that was popular from the early Victorian era circa 1850 and lasting until 1960. It involved a mixture of popular songs, comedy, speciality acts, and variety entertainment. The term is derived from a type of theatre or venue in which such entertainment took place. British music hall was similar to American vaudeville, featuring rousing songs and comic acts, while in the United Kingdom the term ""vaudeville""' referred to more working-class types of entertainment that would have been termed ""burlesque"" in America. Context_6 : Adventures of Dino Riki, known in Japan as Shin Jinrui: The New Type (新人類 THE NEW TYPE ) , is a video game released in 1987 for the Family Computer in Japan and 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the North America. Context_7 : An entremet or entremets ( ; ] ; from Old French, literally meaning ""between servings"") is in modern French cuisine a small dish served between courses or simply a dessert. Originally it was an elaborate form of entertainment dish common among the nobility and upper middle class in Europe during the later part of the Middle Ages and the early modern period. An entremet marked the end of a serving of courses and could be anything from a simple frumenty (a type of wheat porridge) that was brightly colored and flavored with exotic and expensive spices to elaborate models of castles complete with wine fountains, musicians, and food modeled into allegorical scenes. By the end of the Middle Ages, it had evolved almost entirely into dinner entertainment in the form of inedible ornaments or acted performances, often packed with symbolism of power and regality. In English it was more commonly known as a subtlety (also ""sotelty"" or ""soteltie"") and did not include acted entertainment. Context_8 : Entertainment Centrum is to a type of entertainment complex in Canada developed by Pen Equity. There are four Entertainment Centrums: the Oakville, Mississauga, Whitby, and Ottawa (Kanata) Entertainment Centrums.

All four Centrums are anchored by Cineplex Cinemas or Landmark Cinemas multiplex cinema. Context_9 : Continuismo (English: Continuism ) is the practice by incumbents of keeping themselves in office beyond the legal term. Some Latin American heads of state indefinitely extend their rule by way of reducing or abolishing term limits, via constitutional revision. Examples are (Juan Perón, Argentina; Alfredo Stroessner, Paraguay; Evo Morales, Bolivia). Another tactic is legislative enactment, such as with (Jorge Ubico, Guatemala in 1941). A third tactic is by plebiscite (Carlos Castillo Armas, Guatemala [1954]) and Marcos Pérez Jiménez ,Venezuela, 1958)) and the 1988 failed attempt by Augusto Pinochet in Chile. A further type is internal coup (Getulio Vargas, Brazil). Yet another way is the imposition of a weak successor candidate allowing rule by the outgoing incumbent (Emilio Portes Gil and Abelardo Rodríguez in Mexico allowing Plutarco Elías Calles, """"el jefe máximo"""", to continue ruling, a period known as the Maximato). The extension of family rule occurred in Nicaragua with the Somoza family; in Argentina with Juan Perón; and then more recently Nestor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernández de Kirchner; and in Cuba with Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl Castro. Despite Peru's one term limit established by its 1979 constitution, Alberto Fujimori illegally extended his rule to ten years through two re-elections. Context_10 : Online social entertainment blends entertaining interactive functionality and content including live video streaming, video chat communications, multi-player gaming, music and videos streaming, with social networking service such as social graph management, forums, reviews, ratings, and geo-location options. It is the foundation for a more immersive, interactive, enriching and engaging content consumption experience through social channels. Social entertainment is distinct from social networking websites in that the former is based fundamentally on immersive engaging experiences with functionality, content and people, while the latter is based primarily on building and maintaining relationships with other users. Typically, social entertainment is defined by the individual sites dedicated to a particular type of entertainment experience incorporating basic social networking services. fact_1 : Qwirkle is a tile-based game for 2 to 4 players, designed by Susan McKinley Ross and published by MindWare. fact_2 : Evo: The Last Gasp of the Dinosaurs is a German-style board game for three to five players, designed by Philippe Keyaerts and published by Eurogames.

The ground Legion was however not fully formed by the time of German invasion of Poland on 1 September. Most of the soldiers were eventually interned by the invading Soviets on 17 September, while others crossed the Polish-Romanian border and were interned in Romania. The Reconnaissance Squadron was involved in the fight in the air alongside the Polish Air Force, although primarily in the reconnaissance role, as the aircraft they received from Poland (Potez XXV, RWD-8 and PWS-26), were mostly obsolete in air combat.

Context_6 : Ampyx Power is an airborne wind energy company founded in 2008 by Bas Lansdorp and Richard Ruiterkamp. It was created after Lansdorp dropped his five-year-long studies of wind energy at Delft University of Technology to found Ampyx Power. In 2011, Lansdorp sold a majority of his Ampyx Power shares to fund his new project, Mars One. Wubbo Ockels' interest in energy began when he let a kite line slip and it burned his hand. He became interested and started to study and research how this could be turned into electricity. At Delft University, he formed a team with Bas Lansdorp that worked on developing kites that could retrieve energy from the sky. Richard Ruiterkamp became the team leader and he created a fixed wing aircraft that allowed greater controllability and allowing the generation of more energy. In 2008 he founded the company with Bas Lansdorp. Lansdorp worked on the business aspect, and Ruiterkamp was head of the science division. Currently, Ampyx Power has a team of 40 engineers. Their current prototype is the AP3 Ampyx Power Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES). The system is a tethered aircraft that converts wind into electric energy. The aircraft is tethered to an on the ground generator. When the aircraft moves and flies, it reels the tether and powers the generator. The plane is then reeled in through the tether and then re-released into the air. Context_7 : NASA Astronaut Group 9 was announced on May 29, 1980, and completed their training by 1981.

Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen, the Chief of the Imperial Army German General Staff from 1891 to 1906, devised a deployment plan for a war-winning offensive, in a one-front war against the French Third Republic from 1905–06. After the war, the German official historians of the ""Reichsarchiv"" and other writers, described the plan as a blueprint for victory. German historians claimed that the plan had been ruined by ""Generaloberst"" (Colonel-General) Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, the Commander-in-Chief of the German army after Schlieffen retired in 1906, who was dismissed after the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September 1914). Context_2 : The Battle of Elchingen, fought on 14 October 1805, saw French forces under Michel Ney rout an Austrian corps led by Johann Sigismund Riesch. This defeat led to a large part of the Austrian army being invested in the fortress of Ulm by the army of Emperor Napoleon I of France while other formations fled to the east. Soon afterward, the Austrians trapped in Ulm surrendered and the French mopped up most of the remaining Austrians forces, bringing the Ulm Campaign to a close. Context_3 : The 9th Light Infantry Regiment (9e régiment d’infanterie légère) was a French army regiment. One of the most notable infantry regiments in the Napoleonic Wars, it was awarded the title ""Incomparable"" by Napoleon Bonaparte after their brilliant performance at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800. The regiment went on to serve with distinction in the [Ulm Campaign], at the Battle of Dürenstein (11 November 1805), the Jena Campaign (1806), and the Battle of Friedland (14 June 1807). The regiment then served in the Peninsular War taking a notable role at the Battle of Talavera 27–28 July 1809 and the Siege of Badajoz (1812). Battalions from the regiment also fought on the Wagram Campaign (1809), at the Battle of Leipzig (16–19 October 1813), and Napoleon’s campaigns in France (1814). During the Hundred Days the 9th Light fought at Battle of Ligny (16 June 1815) and the Battle of Wavre (18–19 June 1815). The regiment was disbanded in the aftermath of the Bourbon Restoration. Context_4 : The Ulm Campaign was a series of French and Bavarian military maneuvers and battles to outflank and capture an Austrian army in 1805 during the War of the Third Coalition. It took place in the vicinity of and inside the Swabian (then Bavarian) city of Ulm. The French Grande Armée, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, comprised 210,000 troops organized into seven corps, and hoped to knock out the Austrian army in the Danube before Russian reinforcements could arrive. Through rapid marching, Napoleon conducted a large wheeling maneuver that captured an Austrian army of 23,000 under General Mack on 20 October at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60,000. The campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in the development of the Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century. Context_5 : In the Battle of Wertingen (8 October 1805) Imperial French forces led by Marshals Joachim Murat and Jean Lannes attacked a small Austrian corps commanded by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Xaver von Auffenberg. This action, the first battle of the Ulm Campaign, resulted in a clear French victory. Wertingen lies 28 km northwest of Augsburg. The combat was fought during the War of the Third Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Context_6 : Three ships of the French Navy have borne the name Donawerth, in honour of the battle of Donauwörth during the Ulm Campaign : Context_7 : The Reserve Cavalry Corps or Cavalry Reserve of the ""Grande Armée"" was the name of a French military formation that existed during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1805, Emperor Napoleon appointed Marshal Joachim Murat to command all the cavalry divisions that were not directly attached to the Army Corps. During the Ulm Campaign, Murat led his horsemen in successfully hunting down many Austrian Empire units that escaped the Capitulation of Ulm. Murat's horsemen fought at Austerlitz in December 1805. Under Murat, the Cavalry Reserve played a prominent role in the destruction of the Kingdom of Prussia's armies after the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt in 1806. Five dragoon divisions of the corps were employed in the Peninsular War starting in 1808 and placed under the overall command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières. The Cavalry Reserve was reassembled in 1809 to fight Austria with Bessières still in command. In 1812 the Reserve Cavalry Corps was split up into the I, II, III, and IV Cavalry Corps for the French invasion of Russia. Context_8 : Johann Sigismund Graf von Riesch (2 August 1750 – 2 November 1821) joined the army of Habsburg Austria as a cavalry officer and, during his career, fought against the Kingdom of Prussia, Ottoman Turkey, Revolutionary France, and Napoleon's French Empire. He became a general officer during the French Revolutionary Wars and held important commands during the War of the Second Coalition. He displayed a talent for leading cavalry formations, but proved less capable when given corps-sized commands. During the 1805 Ulm Campaign in the Napoleonic Wars, the French badly defeated his corps and forced it to surrender soon afterward. From 1806 to his death in 1821, he was the Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian cavalry regiment. Context_9 : The Battle of Ulm on 16–19 October 1805 was a series of skirmishes, at the end of the Ulm Campaign, which allowed Napoleon I to trap an entire Austrian army under the command of Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich with minimal losses and to force its surrender near Ulm in the Electorate of Bavaria. Context_10 : The Trachenberg Plan was a campaign plan created by Allied commanders in the 1813 German Campaign during the War of the Sixth Coalition of the Napoleonic Wars, and named for the conference held at the palace of Trachenberg. The plan advocated avoiding direct engagement with the French emperor, Napoleon I. This resulted from fear of the Emperor's now legendary prowess in battle. Consequently, the Allies planned to engage and defeat the French Marshals and Generals separately, and thus weaken his army while they built up an overwhelming force even he could not defeat. It was decided upon after a series of defeats and near disasters by the Coalition at Napoleon's hands at the battles of Lützen, Bautzen and Dresden. The plan ultimately worked and at the Battle of Leipzig, where the Allies had a considerable numerical advantage, the Emperor was soundly defeated and driven out of Germany, across the Rhine back into France itself. The plan was an amalgam of two prior works: The Trachenberg Protocol and the Reichenbach Plan, authored by the Austrian chief of staff of the allied coalition, Radetzky and the Swedish Crown Prince Charles John (formerly Napoleon's marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte) whose experience with the tactics and methods of the French Army, as well as personal insight on the mind of Napoleon, proved invaluable. The combined, modified version of the two prior plans became known as the Trachenberg Plan. fact_1 :  The campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in the development of the Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century. fact_2 : The Schlieffen Plan (German: ""Schlieffen-Plan"" , ] ) was the name given after World War I to the thinking behind the German invasion of France and Belgium on 4 August 1914.

Any such highly influential person is referred to as Haridas Pal. The Bengali phrase ""Tumi Kon Haridas Pal?"" (Bengali: তুমি কোন হরিদাস পাল হে?) literally meaning ""Which Haridas Pal are you?"" is often used to question his credentials when someone tries to exert his authority over matters which are apparently beyond his sphere of influence. Through this question he is bluntly told that he doesn't belong to the stature of Haridas Pal and therefore his questioning and suggestions are unwelcome. Later an alternative phrase ""Ke Tumi Haridas Pal?"" (Bengali: কে তুমি হরিদাস পাল?) literally meaning ""Who are you Haridas Pal?"" also began to be used to address the second person as Haridas Pal himself and dismiss him as a non-entity.
