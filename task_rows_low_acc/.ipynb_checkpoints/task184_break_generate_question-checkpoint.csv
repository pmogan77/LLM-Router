Each given step refers to either an entity (known or unknown), a propery of an entity or a query operation (count, group, union, etc.) Knowing those operations and how they appear in the input may help you generate more accurate questions.
 Select: A select step is used to return a set of objects. There are no references to previous steps in a select step. template: Return [attributes]
 Filter: A filter step is used to return results from a previous step to which a certain condition applies. template: Return [#step] [condition]
 Project: A project step should return certain attributes of the results of a previous step. template: Return [attributes] of [#step]
 Aggregate: An aggregate step returns an aggregator function applied on a step's result. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step].
 Group: A group step is an aggregator applied on attributes. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step] for each [attribute]
 Superlative: A superlative step is used to return the result with a highest/lowest attribute among other results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [is] [highest / lowest]
 Comparative: A comparative step is used when we need to compare an attribute with a number to filter results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [comparator] [number] 
 Union: A union step is used to return results of two steps together. template: Return [#step1] [or / ,] [#step2]
 Intersection: An intersection step returns the result that two steps have in common. template: Return [attribute] of both [#step1] and [#step2]
 Discard: A discard step returns result of a step and excludes result of another step from it. template: Return [#step1] besides [#step2]
 Sort: A sort returns result of another step in a specific order. template: Return [#step1] [ordered / sorted by] [#step2]
 Is true: An is true step checks a condition on another result and returns a true or false. template: Return [is / if] [condition]
 Arithmetic: An arithmatic step operates an arithmatic operation on one or more steps. template: Return the [arithmetic op.] of [#step1] [and] [#step2].","#1 return items 
#2 return green cube 
#3 return #1 hidden behind #2 
#4 return color of #3",What is the color of the item hidden behind a green cube?,Is there a sand castle in the background?,0.5302621722221375
